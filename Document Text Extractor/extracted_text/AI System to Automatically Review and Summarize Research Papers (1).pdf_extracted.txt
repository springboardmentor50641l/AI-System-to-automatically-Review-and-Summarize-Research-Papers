AI System to Automatically Review and Summarize Research Papers  
1. Introduction / Objective  
This system automates the process of creating systematic reviews of academic papers 
through a structured workflow. It handles everything from initial paper search to final draft 
generation using a directed graph architecture.  
2. Methodology / Workflow  
1. Research Phase  
• Topic planning and scoping  
• Automated paper search via Semantic Scholar  
• Smart paper selection (up to 3 papers – adjustable)  
• Automatic PDF retrieval  
2. Analysis Phase  
• PDF text extraction  
• Section -by-section analysis  
• Key finding identification  
• Cross -paper comparison  
3. Writing Phase  
• Automated section generation  
• Abstract (100 -word limit)  
• Methods comparison  
• Results synthesis  
• APA reference formatting  
4. Review Phase  
• Quality assessment  
• Revision suggestions  
• Additional research triggers  
• Final draft preparation  
3. Modules  
Paper Retrieval Module: Handles topic -based academic paper search and PDF download 
using Semantic Scholar API.  
Text Extraction Module: Extracts and processes text from PDF documents for structural 
segmentation.  
Analysis Module: Compares findings, highlights key themes, and identifies overlaps among 
papers.  Draft Generation Module: Generates structured sections including Abstract, Methodology, 
and Results using GPT -based models.  
Review Module: Conducts revision checks, adds references, and prepares the final 
document for submission.  
4. System Design / Architecture  
The architecture is graph -based, enabling stateful control over each stage of the review 
pipeline. It ensures reliable progression from search → extraction → analysis → synthesis → 
revision.  
 
 
5. Week -wise Module Implementation and High -Level Requirements  
Milestone 1: Week 1 –2 
• Set up environment and install required dependencies.  
• Implement automated paper search via Semantic Scholar API.  
• Enable selection and download of research PDFs based on topic input.  
• Prepare dataset of selected papers for analysis.  
Milestone 2: Week 3 –4 
• Implement text extraction module for parsing downloaded PDFs.  
• Extract section -wise text data and store it for analysis.  
• Develop key -finding extraction logic and cross -paper comparison module.  
• Validate correctness and completeness of extracted textual data.  
Milestone 3: Week 5 –6 
• Generate automated section drafts using GPT -based models.  
• Implement structured writing for Abstract, Methods, and Results.  
• Integrate synthesis of findings from multiple papers.  
• Format references according to APA style.  
Milestone 4: Week 7 –8 
• Implement review and refinement cycle for generated conten t. 
• Add revision suggestions and quality evaluation modul e. 
• Perform Final UI Integration : Design and implement the polished Gradio  interface  
to clearly present all generated sections (Abstract, Methods comparison, Results 
synthesis) and APA references.  
• Add UI controls (e.g., 'Critique/Revise' button)  to allow user -triggered re -runs of the 
revision cycl e. 
• Prepare final report combining all generated section s. 
• Conduct final testing and prepare documentation and presentation deliverable s.
