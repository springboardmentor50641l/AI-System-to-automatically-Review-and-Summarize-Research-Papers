The study of student perceptions of GenAI, such as ChatGPT, in higher education
reveals a complex and nuanced picture of both enthusiasm and concerns. The findings
of this study provide an insightful understanding of university students’ perception. It
is evident that students are generally familiar with GenAI technologies, and their level
of familiarity is influenced by factors such as knowledge about GenAI and frequency
of use. The results also highlight the potential benefits and risks associated with using
GenAI in teaching and learning, which are perceived differently among students based
on their experiences with GenAI technologies. Overall, the participants showed a good
understanding of the capabilities and limitations of GenAI technologies, as well as a
positive attitude towards using these technologies in their learning, research, and future
careers. However, there were also concerns about the reliability, privacy, ethical issues,
and uncertain policies associated with GenAI, as well as its potential impact on personal

development, career prospects, and societal values. Table 5 shows the benefits and concerns of employing GenAI technologies.
The study revealed that students’ knowledge of GenAI technologies and frequency
of use are positively correlated. This suggests that exposure to these technologies and
hands-on experience may help in enhancing students’ understanding and acceptance of
GenAI. Also, despite the relative novelty of GenAI for public use, students appear to
have knowledge of the technologies and understand its benefits and risks quite well.
Both quantitative and qualitative findings also show that students are generally willing
to use GenAI for their studies and future work, but they have high expectations. For
example, the study found that students perceive GenAI technologies as beneficial for
providing personalized learning support as they expect learning resources tailored to
their needs 24/7. In terms of writing and brainstorming support, students want feedback
to improve writing skills, beyond just grammar checking and brainstorming, similar to
the findings in Atalas’ study (2023). For research and analysis support, students envision
GenAI capabilities to not only facilitate literature searching and summarizing readings
but also to generate hypotheses based on data analysis, enabling them to stay up-to-date
with the latest research trends and build upon initial insights for their own work (Berg,
2023) which would not be expected from previous educational technologies. These findings indicate the potential of GenAI in revolutionizing traditional teaching and learning methods by offering tailored assistance, diverse learning needs, promoting efficiency
and fostering self-directed learning.
Despite the positive outlook, the study also reveals challenges concerning GenAI technologies, with students expressing reservations about over-reliance on the technology,
its potential impact on the value of university education, and issues related to accuracy,
transparency, privacy, and ethics. Students express concerns about the accuracy and ethical issues, particularly plagiarism, as they face difficulty in determining the originality of
work generated by GenAI tools (Peres et al., 2023), which are unable to assess validity or
identify falsehoods, thus necessitating human oversight (Lubowitz, 2023). Interestingly,
there is no significant correlation between students’ concerns and their knowledge about
GenAI technologies, suggesting that even those with a good understanding of the technology may still have reservations, similar to Dahmash et al. (2020)’s findings. Additionally, students were apprehensive about GenAI, which may hinder critical thinking and
creativity, and the impact of GenAI on job prospects (Ghotbi et al., 2022; Gong et al.,
2019; Park et al., 2020) and human values (Gillissen et al., 2022; Jha et al., 2022).

User acceptance is key to the successful uptake of technological innovations, and students are the primary users of educational technologies. By understanding how students
perceive generative AI technologies, educators and policymakers can better understand
how best to integrate these technologies into higher education to enhance teaching and
learning outcomes.
As mentioned, the reasons behind students’ willingness and concerns about GenAI
technologies are multifaceted. On one hand, students are optimistic about the future
integration of these technologies into their academic and professional lives, considering
GenAI as part of the ongoing technological evolution. On the other hand, students have
reservations.
