This study explores university students’ perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness
to engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective integration. A survey of 399
undergraduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines in Hong Kong
revealed a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning. Students
recognized the potential for personalized learning support, writing and brainstorming
assistance, and research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about accuracy,
privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal development, career prospects,
and societal values were also expressed. According to John Biggs’ 3P model, student
perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and outcomes. By understanding students’ perceptions, educators and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies
to address needs and concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes. Insights
from this study can inform policy development around the integration of GenAI technologies into higher education. By understanding students’ perceptions and addressing their concerns, policymakers can create well-informed guidelines and strategies
for the responsible and effective implementation of GenAI tools, ultimately enhancing
teaching and learning experiences in higher education.

**Generative Artificial Intelligence**
Generative AI (GenAI) encompasses a group of machine learning algorithms designed
to generate new data samples that mimic existing datasets. One of the foundational techniques in GenAI is the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which is a type of neural network that learns to encode and decode data in a way that maintains its essential features
(Kingma & Welling, 2013). Another popular GenAI method is Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), which consist of two neural networks working in competition to generate realistic data samples (Goodfellow et al., 2014). GenAI models use advanced algorithms to learn patterns and generate new content such as text, images, sounds, videos,
and code. Some examples of GenAI tools include ChatGPT, Bard, Stable Diffusion, and
Dall-E. Its ability to handle complex prompts and produce human-like output has led to
research and interest into the integration of GenAI in various fields such as healthcare,
medicine, education, media, and tourism.
ChatGPT, for example, has caused a surge of interest in the use of GenAI in higher
education since its release in November 2022 (Hu, 2023). It is a conversational AI system developed by OpenAI, an autoregressive large language model (more than 175 billion parameters) has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. It can generate
human-like responses to a wide range of text-based inputs. The model has been trained
on a diverse range of texts, including books, articles, and websites, allowing it to understand user input, generate responses, and maintain coherent conversations on a wide
range of topics. There has been much discussion on its potential in transforming disciplinary practices such as medical writing (Biswas, 2023; Kitamura, 2023), surgical practice (Bhattacharya et al., 2023), and health care communications (Eggmann et al., 2023)
as well as enhancing higher education teaching and learning (e.g., Adiguzel et al., 2023;
Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023).
**Benefits and challenges of using generative AI in higher education**
One of the key uses of GenAI in higher education is for enhancing students’ learning
experience through its ability to respond to user prompts to generate highly original
output. Text-to-text AI generators can provide writing assistance to students, especially
non-native English-speaking students (Chan & Lee, 2023), by enabling them to brainstorm ideas and get feedback on their writing through applications such as ChatGPT
(Atlas, 2023), while text-to-image AI generators such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion
can serve as valuable tools for teaching technical and artistic concepts in arts and design
(Dehouche & Dehouche, 2023). GenAI tools are also believed to be useful research aids
for generating ideas, synthesizing information, and summarising a vast amount of text
data to help researchers analyse data and compose their writing (Berg, 2023; Chan &
Zhou, 2023), contributing to efficiency in publication (Kitamura, 2023; van Dis et al.,
2023). Another opportunity in which GenAI can bring benefits is learning assessment
(Crompton & Burke, 2023). Tools such as the Intelligent Essay Assessor are used to
grade students’ written work and provide feedback on their performance (Landauer,
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 3 of 18
2003). Mizumoto and Eguchi (2023) examined the reliability and accuracy of ChatGPT
as an automated essay scoring tool, and the results show that ChatGPT shortened the
time needed for grading, ensured consistency in scoring, and was able to provide immediate scores and feedback on students’ writing skills. Such research demonstrates that
GenAI has potential to transform the teaching and learning process as well as improve
student outcomes in higher education.
On the other hand, there have been challenges about the limitations of GenAI and
issues related to ethics, plagiarism, and academic integrity. Kumar’s (2023) analysis
of AI-generated responses to academic writing prompts shows that the text output,
although mostly original and relevant to the topics, contained inappropriate references
and lacked personal perspectives that AI is generally incapable of producing. For second language learners, constructing appropriate prompts poses a challenge in itself as it
requires a certain level of linguistic skills; and overreliance on GenAI tools may compromise students’ genuine efforts to develop writing competence (Warschauer et al., 2023).
In addition, the content produced by GenAI may be biased, inaccurate, or harmful if
the dataset on which a model was trained contains such elements (Harrer, 2023). AIgenerated images, for example, may contain nudity or obscenity and can be created for
malicious purposes such as deepfakes (Maerten & Soydaner, 2023). GenAI tools are not
able to assess validity of content and determine whether the output they generate contains falsehoods or misinformation, thus their use requires human oversight (Lubowitz,
2023). Furthermore, since AI-generated output cannot be detected by most plagiarism
checkers, it is difficult to determine whether a given piece of writing is the author’s original work (Peres et al., 2023). According to Chan (2023a), “it raises the question of what
constitutes unethical behaviour in academic writing including plagiarism, attribution,
copyrights, and authorship in the context of AI-generated content”—an AI-plagiarism.
As Zhai (2022) cautions, the use of text-to-text generators such as ChatGPT may compromise the validity of assessment practices, particularly those involving written assignments. Hence, the widespread use of GenAI can pose a serious threat to academic
integrity in higher education. In Chan and Tsi (2023) study, there is a particular concern
towards holistic competency development such as creativity, critical thinking. The benefits of GenAI underline the potential of the technology as a valuable learning tool for
students, while its limitations and challenges show a need for research into how GenAI
can be effectively integrated in the teaching and learning process. Thus, the research
questions for this study are
1. How familiar are university students with GenAI technologies like ChatGPT?
2. What are the potential benefits and challenges associated with using GenAI in teaching and learning, as perceived by university students?
3. How can GenAI be effectively integrated into higher education to enhance teaching
and learning outcomes?
**Student perceptions of the use of GenAI in higher education**
User acceptance is key to successful uptake of technological innovations (Davis,
1989). John Biggs emphasized the importance of student perception in his 3P
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 4 of 18
(Presage–Process–Product) model of teaching and learning (Biggs, 2011). According to Biggs, students’ perceptions of their learning environment, their abilities, and
the teaching strategies used have a significant impact on their approach to learning
(Biggs, 1999), which in turn influences their learning outcomes. Students who perceive
the learning environment (such as, curriculum content, teaching methods, assessment
methods, learning resources, learning context, student support services) positively and
feel confident about their abilities are more likely to adopt a deep approach to learning, which involves seeking understanding and making connections between concepts.
On the other hand, students who have a negative perception of their learning environment or doubt their abilities may adopt a surface approach to learning, where they focus
on memorizing facts and meeting minimum requirements (Biggs, 2011). In a learning
environment, the way students perceive a technological innovation such as GenAI, their
views, concerns, and experiences of the technology can have impact on their willingness to utilise the tool and consequently the extent to which the tool is integrated in
the learning process. A large proportion of research into tertiary students’ perceptions
in this area focuses on AI in general and chatbots which are not necessarily powered
by GenAI, while students’ views and experiences of GenAI tools specifically remain
relatively underexplored. Research into student perceptions of AI/GenAI typically
investigates students’ attitudes, their experiences of AI, and factors influencing their perceptions such as gender, disciplines, age, and year of study.
_Attitudes towards AI and experiences of AI_ Research into the use of AI in language
classrooms shows that students found AI tools such as chatbots and Plot Generator useful for enhancing language acquisition by providing assistance with grammar, guiding
them in generating ideas, and helping them communicate in the target language (Bailey
et al., 2021; Sumakul et al., 2020). AI KAKU, a GenAI tool based on the GPT-2 language
model, was implemented in English language lessons with Japanese students and was
perceived to be easy to use and able to assist students to express themselves in English
(Gayed et al., 2022); while the use of AI-based chatbots for learning support improved
students’ learning achievement, self-efficacy, learning attitude, and learning motivation
(Essel et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). A study of the use of chatbots in business education also reported favourable user feedback with students citing positive learning experience due to chatbots’ responsiveness, interactivity, and confidential learning support
(Chen et al., 2023). Most students agreed that AI have a profound impact on their disciplines and future careers (e.g., Bisdas et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2019; Sit et al., 2020)
and expressed an intention to utilise AI in their learning and future practice (e.g., Bisdas
et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022), and thus viewed integration of AI as an essential part of
university curricula (e.g., Abdelwahab et al., 2022; Bisdas et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2019;
Yüzbaşioğlu, 2021).
Students who had a good understanding of AI were also found to express a low level of
anxiety about AI in Dahmash et al.’s (2020) study. However, Jeffrey’s (2020) study found
conflicting beliefs among college students. Students who had a high level of understanding and information about AI and believed that AI could benefit them personally also
expressed concerns about the impact of AI on human jobs. In Dahmash et al.’s (2020)
and Gong et al.’s (2019) research, the choice of radiology as a future career was associated with the impact of AI—The number of medical students indicating radiology as
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 5 of 18
their specialty choice increased when the potential impact of AI was not a consideration. Among the concerns and drawbacks regarding the use of AI, as perceived by students, are limited human interaction/element (e.g., Bisdas et al., 2021; Essel et al., 2022),
potential data leakage (e.g., Bisdas et al., 2021), absence of emotional connection (Chen
et al., 2023), breach of ethics (e.g., Gillissen et al., 2022; Jha et al., 2022), and reduced
job opportunities or increased demand in job practices (Ghotbi et al., 2022; Gong et al.,
2019; Park et al., 2020).
_Frequency of use/Time spent on AI tools_ Research examining the relationship between
frequency of AI use and student perceptions of AI is inconclusive. For example, Yildiz
Durak’s (2023) study of 86 students in a university in Turkey reported no correlation
between chatbot usage frequency and visual design self-efficacy, course satisfaction,
chatbot usage satisfaction, and learner autonomy. The finding shows that frequency of
use alone is not a meaningful factor, while satisfaction with use can impact users’ selfefficacy. In contrast, Bailey et al. (2021) found that the amount of time spent on chatbot
use in a second language writing class was positively associated with students’ confidence in using the target language and perception of task value.
_Use of Methodology_ Most of the research into student perceptions of AI/GenAI
employs a quantitative survey design (e.g., Bisdas et al., 2021; Dahmash et al., 2020;
Gherhes & Obrad, 2018; Yüzbaşioğlu, 2021). Some studies incorporated open-ended
survey questions (e.g., Hew et al., 2023; Jeffrey, 2020) and semi-structured interviews
(e.g., Gillissen et al., 2022; Mokmin & Ibrahim, 2021; Park et al., 2020) to gather students’ free responses and to probe their views on the research topic in addition to their
responses to survey questions. For example, Park et al.’s (2020) study consisted of two
stages: Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone in Stage
1, followed by an Internet-based survey in Stage 2. Studies that examined the impact of
AI and student perceptions typically adopted an experimental design using a pretestintervention-posttest approach and the administration of a questionnaire to examine
student perceptions (e.g., Essel et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). Qualitative research is relatively rare as only the views of a small number of students can be explored with such
an approach. For example, Sumakul et al.’s (2020) and Terblanche et al.’s (2022) studies
based on semi-structured interviews involved eight students and 20 students respectively. In contrast, survey is more effective for reaching a large population of respondents from different geographical locations as shown in previous studies such as Bisdas
et al. (2021), Dahmash et al., (2020), and Gong et al. (2019).
Although there has been a considerable amount of research into AI in general as
shown in the review of current studies in this section, there is currently lack of investigation into how students perceive GenAI. In view of the unprecedented interest in GenAI
at present, there is a need to examine university students’ attitude towards GenAI and
their experience of using GenAI in order to gain insights into how it can be integrated in
higher education to enhance teaching and learning.
