In this study, student perception of GenAI technologies were investigated. According to Biggs (1999, 2011), student perceptions of their learning environment, abilities,
and teaching strategies significantly influence their learning approach and outcomes,
with positive perceptions leading to a deep learning approach and negative perceptions
resulting in a surface approach. Thus, it is vital to understand student perception in the
context of GenAI technologies. By taking students’ perceptions into account, educators
and policymakers can better tailor GenAI technologies to address students’ needs and
concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes.
Understanding students on their willingness and concerns regarding the use of GenAI
tools can help educators to better integrate these technologies into the learning process,
ensuring they complement and enhance traditional teaching methods. This integration can lead to improved learning outcomes, as students will be more likely to adopt
a deep approach to learning when they perceive GenAI as a valuable and supportive
resource. Students’ perceptions can provide insights into their level of AI literacy, which
is essential for responsible use of GenAI technologies. By identifying gaps in students’
understanding, educators can develop targeted interventions to improve AI literacy and
prepare students for future employment in an increasingly AI-driven world. In the findings, students highlight the potential risks and concerns, educators can create guidelines
and safeguards that ensure responsible and ethical use of GenAI technologies.
**Implications**
The diverse range of opinions among the participants highlights some implications that
must be considered to ensure the successful integration of GenAI into higher education.
According to the 3P model proposed by Biggs (2011), three key elements that can influence learning outcomes include student-dependent factors, teaching-dependent factors, and interactive impacts from the whole system. With this framework in mind, it
is important for students to develop their AI literacy, which includes understanding the
basics of Generative AI, how it works, its advantages, and disadvantages, as well as different uses in higher education. Meanwhile, when using Generative AI, they should ensure
that their use aligns with ethical principles and does not cause any harm to society.
Additionally, as some students expressed concerns about their holistic competencies’
development, teachers can play a vital role in developing their high-order skills, perhaps
with the help of GenAI as mentioned in (Chan & Tsi, 2023). For example, teachers can

encourage students to critically evaluate AI-generated content and distinguish between
reliable and unreliable sources to develop their critical thinking skills. Or Generative AI
can be used to spark students’ creativity by generating diverse and unpredictable ideas
and prompts. Since holistic competencies may become the most in-demand attributes
for today’s work environment, a focus on competency development in instructional
designs could also relieve students’ anxiety concerning career prospects.
In the foreseeable future, as generative AI may potentially be widely used in formal
academic settings, institutions should also develop policies and provide formal guidance
on the use of Generative AI. Chan (2023b) suggests an AI Ecological Education Policy
Framework to tackle the various implications of AI integration in university teaching
and learning with three dimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Operational. Firstly,
institutions should consider providing educational resources and workshops to familiarize students with GenAI technologies and their ethical and societal implications. This
would enable students to make informed decisions when using these technologies in
their academic endeavors.
Secondly, the development and implementation of GenAI technologies should prioritize transparency, accuracy, and privacy to foster trust and mitigate potential risks. For
example, technical staff could work on explainable AI models that provide clear explanations of their decision-making processes. In addition, robust data protection policies and
practices should be in place to safeguard users’ privacy.
Lastly, higher education institutions should consider rethinking their policy, curricula
and teaching approaches to better prepare students for a future where GenAI technologies are prevalent. This may involve fostering interdisciplinary learning, emphasizing
critical thinking and creativity, and cultivating digital literacy and AI ethics education.
In conclusion, this study sheds light on the diverse perspectives of university students
towards GenAI technologies and underscores the need for a balanced approach to integrating these technologies into higher education. By addressing students’ concerns and
maximizing the potential benefits, higher education institutions can harness the power
of GenAI to enhance teaching and learning outcomes while also preparing students for
the future workforce in the AI-era.
**Limitations and future research**
This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of
the results to the broader population of students in Hong Kong. The study’s reliance on
self-reported data may also introduce potential biases, as participants could have been
influenced by social desirability or inaccurate recall of their experiences with GenAI
technologies. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for
an examination of changes in students’ perceptions over time as their exposure to and
experiences with GenAI technologies evolve. Lastly, since Gen AI has not been fully
used in formal academic settings, students have limited exposure to it. This study did not
explore how students were exposed to AI and the actual impact of GenAI on students’
learning outcomes, which would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of these technologies in education.

Future research should address these limitations by employing larger, more diverse
samples; using longitudinal designs to track changes in students’ perceptions of generative AI over time and explore how these technologies are integrated into higher education; and examining the relationship between GenAI use and learning outcomes.
Additionally, future research could explore on a specific group of students from different
discipline, academic backgrounds, age groups, or cultural contexts on AI literacy.
Overall, there is a need for further research to better understand how best to integrate
generative AI into higher education while minimizing potential risks related to privacy
and security. By exploring these areas, we can ensure that these technologies are used
responsibly and effectively in teaching and learning contexts.
