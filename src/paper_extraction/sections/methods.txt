positive and negative expressions in the review, thus complicating
accurate emotion prediction.


In a related study on YouTube comments, Smita Shree and Josh Brolin
proposed a lexicon-based, unsupervised approach to sentiment polarity
detection. In spite of a knowledge-based approach and the preparation
of a social media lexicon representing user sentiments, the results
indicated a lower recall rate for negative sentiments than for positive

ones, blaming this on a wider variability in the linguistic expression of
frustration and dissatisfaction.


Other research around sentiment analysis carried out in social
networks like Twitter emphasizes moods of individuals and how they
are influenced by events in the social, political, cultural, and economic
arena. A very recent work by A. Kowcika et al. explores how to extract
information from Twitter and to conduct efficient sentiment analysis
on tweets related to the Smartphone war aiming to classify users based
on age and gender. Krisztian Balog et al. also proposed a method for
sentiment analysis about the Smartphone war using a very effective
rating process.


The paper "Twitter Sentiment Analysis: the Good, the Bad, and the
OMG!" authored by Efthymios Kouloumpis et al. describes a study in
which the effectiveness of language features in detecting Twitter
sentiment is analyzed. The existing lexical resources and some relating
informal language were evaluated in doing this. Also, sentiment
analysis of blog posts was also done by Gilad Mishne et al.


Daniele Riboni performed significant work in the classification of Web
pages, concerning feature selection in the paper "Feature Selection for
Website Classification." Experimenting on a corpus of 8000
documents from 10 Yahoo! categories, Kernel Perception and Naive
Bayes classifiers were utilized. The study pointed out how
dimensionality reduction is important and a new structured weighing
procedure is presented. A new representation of linked pages through
local information was also introduced, making hypertext
categorization appropriate for real-time applications.


Another pertinent classification study, conducted by Eibe Frank et al.,
proposed an effective correction by adjusting attribute priors. As this
adjustment was installed as an additional normalization step in the
data, hence it strengthened the area under the ROC curve. The authors
demonstrated the close relationship between the modified version of
MNB and the simple centroid-based classifier, comparing the two
methods empirically.


Diana Maynard et al. investigated a multimodal approach in their paper
on social media sentiment analysis. The goal was to help archivists
select material for an archive about social media while emphasizing a
structured preservation on semantic categories. The rule-based textual
approach accounted for challenges unique to social media, including
fact-finding with noisy grammatical text alongside expletives and
sarcasm.
