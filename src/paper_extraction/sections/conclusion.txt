The sentiment analysis system is built on YouTube comments by
employing different machine learning classifiers such as Naïve Bayes,
support vector machine, decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbor, and random forest. Different features are used to go through
the classification and optimization, applying his dataset that is divided
into training and testing sets in action. The performance of classifiers
was evaluated through different metrics including F-score and
accuracy.


As much as using the uni-gram helps achieve a micro-F score of 87%,
an enhancement yielding a 9% improvement over the base system.
Further enhancing by lemmatization and removal of stop words yields
a macro-F score of 49%. Long story short, the system achieves
consistent micro-F scores at 87% using bi-gram and tri-gram features,
optimizing itself further to an 11% with additional pairwise training.


We got this number for the macro-F to be 49% through a reduction in
the dimensions of data by means of the lemmatization process and a
stop-word removal mechanism. In conclusion, we have made very
reasonable progress in gaining a maximum micro-F of 87% and
macro-F of 49%, not underscoring the considerable advances we have
done in sentiment analysis on YouTube comments.
