The research focuses on gathering YouTube comments made by
the public with the aim of evaluating user attitudes toward different
aspects of a video expressed in their written descriptions. Sentiment
analysis is important, as such analyses allow for the quick and clear
understanding of the sentiments expressed on a large volume of text,
thus translating user opinions into actionable value. This generally

includes positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, views, attitudes,
impressions, emotions, and feelings expressed in the text.


As one of the leading and most widely used platforms, YouTube
sustains staggering figures: over 1 billion unique users that watch more
than 6 billion hours of video per month. It accounts for 20% of web
traffic and 10% of total internet traffic. YouTube has a number of
social mechanisms for gauging user feedback, such as voting, rating,
favoriting, sharing, and commenting. Particularly notable is the fact
that Youtube does more than merely share videos: users can subscribe
to video channels, comment on videos, and interact with one another,
resulting in a fertile mix of implicit and explicit interactions among
users. It is this social dimension of YouTube that separates it from its
more traditional content providers.


This study conducts sentient analysis over a public comment stream
from the annotated corpus of 1500 citation sentences. Based on
mapping rules, the annotation of the corpus where polarity is assigned
to citation sentences was done accordingly.

Studies conducted by different researchers on sentiment analysis cover
Twitter and YouTube. They perform the analysis of comments, tweets,
and metadata picked from user profiles or public events associated
with these social networks in order to derive essential observations
about their overall usage patterns.


Still, sentiment classification accuracy will not be as high as that for
standard topic-based text categorization via machine learning
methods. The arising difficulty is the concurrent presence of some
positive and negative expressions in the review, thus complicating
accurate emotion prediction.


In a related study on YouTube comments, Smita Shree and Josh Brolin
proposed a lexicon-based, unsupervised approach to sentiment polarity
detection. In spite of a knowledge-based approach and the preparation
of a social media lexicon representing user sentiments, the results
indicated a lower recall rate for negative sentiments than for positive

ones, blaming this on a wider variability in the linguistic expression of
frustration and dissatisfaction.


Other research around sentiment analysis carried out in social
networks like Twitter emphasizes moods of individuals and how they
are influenced by events in the social, political, cultural, and economic
arena. A very recent work by A. Kowcika et al. explores how to extract
information from Twitter and to conduct efficient sentiment analysis
on tweets related to the Smartphone war aiming to classify users based
on age and gender. Krisztian Balog et al. also proposed a method for
sentiment analysis about the Smartphone war using a very effective
rating process.


The paper "Twitter Sentiment Analysis: the Good, the Bad, and the
OMG!" authored by Efthymios Kouloumpis et al. describes a study in
which the effectiveness of language features in detecting Twitter
sentiment is analyzed. The existing lexical resources and some relating
informal language were evaluated in doing this. Also, sentiment
analysis of blog posts was also done by Gilad Mishne et al.


Daniele Riboni performed significant work in the classification of Web
pages, concerning feature selection in the paper "Feature Selection for
Website Classification." Experimenting on a corpus of 8000
documents from 10 Yahoo! categories, Kernel Perception and Naive
Bayes classifiers were utilized. The study pointed out how
dimensionality reduction is important and a new structured weighing
procedure is presented. A new representation of linked pages through
local information was also introduced, making hypertext
categorization appropriate for real-time applications.


Another pertinent classification study, conducted by Eibe Frank et al.,
proposed an effective correction by adjusting attribute priors. As this
adjustment was installed as an additional normalization step in the
data, hence it strengthened the area under the ROC curve. The authors
demonstrated the close relationship between the modified version of
MNB and the simple centroid-based classifier, comparing the two
methods empirically.


Diana Maynard et al. investigated a multimodal approach in their paper
on social media sentiment analysis. The goal was to help archivists
select material for an archive about social media while emphasizing a
structured preservation on semantic categories. The rule-based textual
approach accounted for challenges unique to social media, including
fact-finding with noisy grammatical text alongside expletives and
sarcasm.

Badjatiya et al., and Mehmood, Essam, Shafi. They appear to examine
different aspects of sentiment analysis, opinion mining, deep learning
for hate speech detection, and sentiment analysis in Roman Urdu,
contributing some more insights to the respective domain of research.
