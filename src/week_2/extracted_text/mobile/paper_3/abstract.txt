**5G communications, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in**
**mobile computing, from the centralized Mobile Cloud Computing**
**towards** _**Mobile Edge Computing**_ **(MEC). The main feature of**
**MEC is to push mobile computing, network control and storage**
**to the network edges (e.g., base stations and access points) so as**
**to enable computation-intensive and latency-critical applications**
**at the resource-limited mobile devices. MEC promises dramatic**
**reduction in latency and mobile energy consumption, tackling**
**the key challenges for materializing 5G vision. The promised**
**gains of MEC have motivated extensive efforts in both academia**
**and industry on developing the technology. A main thrust of**
**MEC research is to seamlessly merge the two disciplines of**
**wireless communications and mobile computing, resulting in a**
**wide-range of new designs ranging from techniques for compu-**
**tation offloading to network architectures. This paper provides a**
**comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art MEC research with**
**a focus on joint radio-and-computational resource management.**
**We also discusse a set of issues, challenges and future research**
**directions for MEC research, including MEC system deployment,**
**cache-enabled MEC, mobility management for MEC, green**
**MEC, as well as privacy-aware MEC. Advancements in these**
**directions will facilitate the transformation of MEC from theory**
**to practice. Finally, we introduce recent standardization efforts**
**on MEC as well as some typical MEC application scenarios.**
