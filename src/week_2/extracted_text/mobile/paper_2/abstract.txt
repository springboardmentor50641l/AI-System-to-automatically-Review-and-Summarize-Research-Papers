_We introduce an extremely computation-efficient CNN_
_architecture named ShuffleNet, which is designed specially_
_for mobile devices with very limited computing power (e.g.,_
_10-150 MFLOPs). The new architecture utilizes two new_
_operations, pointwise group convolution and channel shuf-_
_fle, to greatly reduce computation cost while maintaining_
_accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet classification and MS_
_COCO object detection demonstrate the superior perfor-_
_mance of ShuffleNet over other structures, e.g. lower top-1_
_error (absolute 7.8%) than recent MobileNet [12] on Ima-_
_geNet classification task, under the computation budget of_
_40 MFLOPs. On an ARM-based mobile device, ShuffleNet_
_achieves ∼13× actual speedup over AlexNet while main-_
_taining comparable accuracy._
