#### **_2 July 2018_**
#### **Executive Summary**
Food has the potential to nurture human health and support environmental
sustainability. Instead, our food is threatening both. The challenge before us is to
provide a growing global population with healthy diets from sustainable food systems.
While global food production of calories has generally kept pace with population growth,
approximately 800 million people still lack sufficient food, and many more consume lowquality diets that result in micronutrient deficiencies and contribute to an alarming rise in
obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Unhealthy diets now pose
a greater risk to morbidity and mortality than unsafe sex, alcohol, and drug and tobacco
use combined. With much of the world’s population inadequately nourished and many of
the environmental systems that regulate the state of the planet pushed beyond safe
boundaries by food production, the need for a global transformation of the food system
is urgent.
The EAT-Lancet Commission _Our Food in the Anthropocene: Healthy Diets from_
_Sustainable Food Systems_ brings together more than 20 experts in various fields of
human health and environmental sustainability to develop global scientific targets based
on the best evidence available for healthy diets and sustainable food production. These
global targets define a safe operating space for food systems that allow us to evaluate
which diets and food production practices together will help ensure that the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Paris Agreement are achieved. Currently,
lack of scientific targets for achieving healthy diets from sustainable food systems has
hindered large-scale and coordinated efforts to transform the global food system.
A first step in the work of the Commission was to describe quantitatively a universal
healthy reference diet to provide a basis for estimating the health and environmental
impacts of adopting an alternative to current diets. Scientific targets for healthy diets,
are presented in Table 1, based on the extensive literature on foods, dietary patterns,
and health outcomes. It is composed largely of vegetables and fruits, whole grains,
legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils; low to moderate consumption of seafood and
poultry; and zero to low consumption of red meat, processed meat, added sugar,
refined grains, and starchy vegetables. Currently, the average intake of healthy foods is
far below recommended levels while overconsumption of unhealthy foods is increasing.
This is contributing to a rising prevalence of obesity and diet-related NCDs, including
coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Using several approaches, we found with
a high level of certainty that global adoption of the reference dietary pattern would
provide major health benefits, including a large reduction in total mortality.

The Commission has integrated, with the quantification of universal healthy diets, global
scientific targets for sustainable food systems. The objective is to provide scientific
boundaries to reduce environmental degradation arising from food production at all
scales. The quantification of scientific targets for the safe operating space of food
systems in the world, was done for the key environmental systems and processes
where food production plays a dominant role in determining the state of the planet.
There is strong scientific evidence that food production is among the largest drivers of
global environmental change due to its contributions to greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, biodiversity loss, freshwater use, eutrophication, and land-system change
(as well as chemical pollution, which is not assessed by this Commission). In turn, food
production depends upon the continued functioning of these biophysical systems and
processes in regulating and maintaining a stable Earth system. These systems and
processes thereby provide a necessary set of globally systemic indicators of what
constitutes sustainable food production. The Commission concludes that these
quantitative scientific targets for sustainable food systems, constitute universal and
scalable planetary boundaries for the food system, (Table 2). However, the uncertainty
range for these food boundaries remain high, due to the inherent complexity in Earth
system dynamics from local ecosystems to the functioning of the biosphere and the
climate system.

Diets provide an inextricable link between human health and environmental
sustainability. The scientific targets for healthy diets and sustainable food systems are
integrated into a common framework (i.e. safe operating space for food systems) so that
“win-win” diets (both healthy and environmentally sustainable) can be identified. We
propose that this framework is universal for all food cultures and food production
systems in the world, with a high potential of local adaptation and scalability.
Applying this framework to future projections of world development, indicates that food
systems can potentially provide the healthy diets (i.e. reference diet) for an anticipated
world population of nearly 10 billion people by 2050 and still stay within a safe operating
space on Earth. However, even small increases in red meat or dairy foods would make
this difficult or impossible. Within the sustainable food production boundaries, the
components of the reference diet can be used to make meals that are consistent with
taste and dietary preferences of all regions of the world. The ranges provided within the
reference diet allow for ample variation across scales and cultures in foods, production
methods, and technologies as well as global dietary patterns.
Given that food systems are the major driver of poor health and environmental
degradation, global efforts are urgently needed to collectively transform diets and food
production. An integrative framework combined with scientific targets, as proposed by
this Commission, can provide essential support for a sustainable and healthy food
transformation. It is a hopeful conclusion that this Commission finds that global food
systems have the potential to provide “win-win” diets to everyone on the planet in 2050
and beyond, while greatly improving health and enabling a sustainable future. However,
achieving this dual aim will require a rapid adoption of numerous interventions and
unprecedented global collaboration and commitment: nothing less than a Great Food
Transformation.
In this report, our focus is mainly on environmental sustainability of food production and
health consequences of final consumption. However, the “food system” consists of
much more than these dimensions. A transformation of the global food system must
ultimately involve multiple stakeholders, from individual consumers to policy makers and
actors along the food value chain, working together toward the shared global goal of
healthy and sustainable diets for all.
Yet, humanity has never set out deliberately to change the global food system on the
scale envisioned in this report; this is uncharted policy territory and there is no magic
‘fix’ to the problems outlined by this Commission. Three lessons can be learned from
other examples of societal responses to global changes. First, no single actor or
breakthrough is likely to catalyse systems change. Transformation depends on diversity
and interactions. Second, science and evidence-gathering are keys to change.
Transformation depends on the fresh perspectives brought by knowledge integration.
Third, a full range of policy levers, from soft to hard, will be needed. Transformation
depends on shifting away from undesired activities while providing opportunities and
incentives for desired actions to flourish Together, these lessons guide the thinking that
will be necessary for achieving a sustainable food system transformation.
In addition, we outline five specific and implementable strategies. For each of these,
there is a strong enough evidence base, and our modelling and analysis demonstrates
their effectiveness for achieving a Great Food Transformation.
4
**Strategy one: winning international and national commitment to shift toward**
**healthy diets** . The scientific targets set out by this Commission provide guidance about
the necessary shift, which consists of high consumption of plant foods and substantially
limiting animal source foods. Ample research has demonstrated that this will reduce
environmental impacts and lead to better health outcomes. This concerted commitment
can be demonstrated by investment in public health information and sustainability
education, and better coordination between departments of health and environment.
**Strategy two: reorienting agricultural priorities away from producing ‘more’ food**
**and towards producing ‘better’ food.** This means focusing on producing a diverse
range of nutritious foods from biodiversity-enhancing food production systems rather
than aiming for increased volume of a few crops, much of which is now used for animal
production.
**Strategy three: sustainably intensifying food production, generating more high-**
**quality output** . The current food system in the world is unsustainable, transgressing
the scientific targets for sustainable food production within the boundaries defined by
this Commission. A new agricultural revolution is required, based on sustainable
intensification, and driven by sustainability and system innovation. This would entail
closing yield gaps on current cropland, radical improvements in fertilizer and water use
efficiency, recycling of phosphorus, redistribution of global use of nitrogen and
phosphorus, implementing climate mitigation options including changes in crop and feed
management, and enhancing biodiversity within agricultural systems.
**Strategy four: Stronger and coordinated governance of land and oceans.** This
implies implementing a zero-expansion policy of new agricultural land into natural
ecosystems and species-rich forests, management policies aimed at restoring and
reforesting degraded land, establishing international land use governance mechanisms,
and adopting a "Half Earth" strategy for conservation of biodiversity in intact
ecosystems. Moreover, there is a need to improve the management of the world’s
oceans, to ensure that fisheries do not negatively impact ecosystems, fish stocks are
utilized responsibly, and global aquaculture production is expanded sustainably.
**Strategy five: at least halving food losses and waste, in line with global**
**sustainable development goals.** Substantially reducing the amount of food lost and
wasted across the food value chain, from production to consumption, is essential for the
global food system to stay within its safe operating space. Both technological solutions
applied along the food supply chain and implementation of public policies will be needed
to achieve a 50% reduction in food loss and waste.
Food will be a defining issue of the 21 [st] century and unlocking its potential will catalyse
pathways for global adoption of healthy diets from sustainable food systems, which is
fundamental to achieving the SDGs and Paris Agreement. An unprecedented
opportunity exists to develop food systems as a common thread between many
ambitious international, national, and business policy frameworks aiming for improved
human health and environmental sustainability goals. Establishing clear, scientific
targets to guide food system transformation is an important step in realizing this
opportunity.

#### **Conclusions**
1. Unhealthy and unsustainably produced food poses a global risk for people and
planet. Nearly 1 billion people in the world lack sufficient food and many more consume
an unhealthy diet that contributes to premature death and morbidity. Simultaneously,
global food production is the single largest human pressure on Earth, threatening local
ecosystems and the stability of the entire Earth system.
2. Present dietary trends, combined with projected population growth to nearly 10 billion
by 2050, will exacerbate these conditions. The global burden of non-communicable
diseases is set to worsen and the impacts of food production on greenhouse gas
emissions, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, biodiversity loss, and water and land use
will erode the stability of the Earth system.
3. A transformation to healthy diets from sustainable food systems is a prerequisite for
attaining the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement, and scientific
targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production are needed to guide a Great
Food Transformation.
4. Healthy diets have an appropriate caloric intake and consist largely of a diversity of
plant foods, low amounts of animal source foods, contain unsaturated rather than
saturated fats, and limited amounts of refined grains, highly processed foods and added
sugars.
5. Transformation to healthy diets by 2050 will require substantial dietary shifts,
including a greater than 50% reduction in global consumption of unhealthy foods such
as red meat and sugar, and a greater than 100% increase in the consumption of healthy
foods such as nuts, fruits, vegetables and legumes. However, the changes needed
differ greatly by region.
6. Dietary changes from current diets towards healthy diets are likely to result in
significant health benefits that include averting approximately 7.4 to 10.8 million
premature deaths per year, a reduction of between 18% to 28%.
7. With food production currently causing major global environmental risks, sustainable
food production needs to operate within the safe operating space for food systems. This
means that producing food for nearly 10 billion people should: use no additional land;
safeguard existing biodiversity; reduce consumptive water use and manage water
responsibly; drastically reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution; produce zero carbon
dioxide emissions and cause no further increase in methane and nitrous oxide
emissions.
8. Transformation to sustainable food production by 2050 will require at least: a 75%
closing of yield gaps; a global redistribution of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use;
recycling of phosphorus; radical improvements in fertilizer and water use efficiency;
rapid implementation of agricultural mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and adoption of land management practices that shifts agriculture from
carbon source to sink, and a fundamental shift in production priorities.

9. The scientific targets for healthy diets from sustainable food systems that we have
described are intertwined across all UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In
particular, this includes eradicating hunger and universal access to high quality primary
health care that integrates family planning and education on healthy diets, with the
SDGs on freshwater, climate, land, oceans and biodiversity and achieved through a
strong commitment to global partnerships and action.
10. Achieving healthy diets from sustainable food systems for everyone on the
planet will require substantial shifts towards healthy dietary patterns together with large
reductions in food losses and waste and major improvements in food production
practices. This universal goal is within reach but will require adoption of scientific targets
by all sectors to stimulate a broad spectrum of actions from individuals and
organizations working in all sectors and at all scales.
#### **Chapter 1 – Introduction**
##### **Food, Planet, Health**
The past 50 years have witnessed dramatic global shifts in the way food is produced
and in dietary patterns. The focus on increasing crop yields and improving production
practices contributed to reductions in hunger, improved life expectancy, falling infant
and child mortality rates, and decreased global poverty levels. [1] These health benefits,
however, are being offset by global shifts to unhealthy diets that are high in calories and
in heavily-processed and animal source foods. These trends are driven partly by rapid
urbanization, increasing incomes, and limited accessibility of nutritious foods. [2,3]
Transitions to unhealthy diets are not only increasing the burden of obesity and dietrelated non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but are also contributing to environmental
degradation. [4,5] As such, our food in the Anthropocene represents one of the greatest
health and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century.
**#### Insert Panel 1 – Glossary ####**
Significant steps have been taken to improve nutrition in recent decades. Yet the
shortcoming of these advancements is evident because wide-scale undernutrition still
exists, now alongside rising overweight, obesity and accompanying NCDs; low dietary
quality contributes to both and has caused persistent micronutrient deficiencies.
Globally, 815 million people remain undernourished, [6] 155 million children are stunted,
52 million children are wasted, [7] and over 2 billion individuals are micronutrient
deficient. [8] At the same time, diseases associated with high-calorie, unhealthy diets are
becoming more prevalent, with 2.1 billion adults overweight or obese [9] and the global
prevalence of diabetes nearly doubling in the last 30 years. [10,11] Today, unhealthy diets
are the largest global burden of disease, [12] and pose a greater risk to morbidity and
mortality than unsafe sex, alcohol, drug and tobacco use combined. [3] With much of the
world’s population inadequately nourished, in terms of under-, over- and malnutrition,
there is an urgent need to greatly transform our diets.
Today, food production constitutes the single largest cause of global environmental
change. Agriculture occupies nearly 40% of global land, [13] and food production is
responsible for up to 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [14] and 70% of
freshwater use. [15-17] The destruction of natural ecosystems to croplands and pastures is
7
the single largest factor causing species to be threatened with extinction. [18] Overuse and
misuse of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) causes eutrophication and dead zones in
lakes and coastal zones. [19,20] The environmental burden from food production also
includes marine systems. Almost 60% of world fish stocks are fully fished, more than
30% overfished, and global marine fisheries catch has been declining since 1996. [21,22] In
addition, the rapidly expanding aquaculture sector can have negative impacts on
coastal habitats. [23] Faced with the challenge of feeding nearly 10 billion people a healthy
and sustainable diet by 2050, and with a rising number of environmental systems and
processes that regulate the state of ecosystems and the Earth system being pushed
beyond planetary boundaries by food production, there is an urgent need to radically
rethink how we produce food.
##### **An integrated agenda for food systems**
Diets are a major link between human health and environmental sustainability. [4,5]
Certain “lose-lose” diets [24] or those that are unhealthy and environmentally
unsustainable are often characterized as being high in calories, added sugars,
saturated fats, highly processed foods and red meats. In addition, the environmental
degradation resulting from these “lose-lose” diets may further compound poor health.
This includes premature deaths caused by poor air quality from biomass burning for
agriculture and land clearing; [25] reduced food security resulting from lower yields due to
changing climactic conditions; [26] diminished nutrient content of some crops in response
to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations; [27-32] and famine exacerbated by extreme
weather events such as drought. [6] This Commission focuses mainly on the link between
diet, human health and environmental sustainability, while several other Lancet
Commissions have explored additional dimensions including the Rockefeller-Lancet
Commission on Planetary Health [1], the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate
Change, [33] and the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health. [34]
Given the impact that current food systems are having on human health and
environmental sustainability, nothing short of a transformation of the global food system
is needed to begin reversing current trends. This transformation, however, will not be
achieved without a paradigm shift in how we view and engage with food systems. This
paradigm shift must recognize the inextricable link between human health and
environmental sustainability and integrate these separate concerns into a common
global agenda to achieve healthy diets from sustainable food systems. The call for an
integrated agenda has existed since the 1980s [35], and it is in this tradition that the EATLancet Commission places the concept of integrated human health and environmental
sustainability at the centre of our work.
Two major global agendas have human health and environmental sustainability at their
core. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [36] seek to end poverty, protect
the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. This ambitious and inclusive international policy
framework includes human health or environmental sustainability in most of its goals.
The Paris Agreement, although centrally focused on climate change, also
acknowledges the “right to health” and the need for climate action for human health.
Furthermore, reaching the Paris Agreement of keeping global warming well under 2°C
with a focus on 1.5°C, is not possible only by decarbanising the global energy system, it
also requires a transition to food systems that can provide negative emissions (function
as major carbon sink, instead of today being a major carbon source), and sustaining
carbon sinks in natural ecosystems. Integral to the Paris Agreement is the requirement
8
of a human health and environmental sustainability food revolution. [37,38] Given the
disproportionate impact of food systems on human health and environmental
sustainability, these global agendas provide an unprecedented opportunity for
catalysing the paradigm shift that will be necessary to transform the global food system.
##### **Defining a safe operating space for food systems**
An integrated human health and environmental sustainability agenda alone will not be
enough to achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. Clear scientific targets that
define healthy diets and sustainable food production are necessary to guide policy
makers, business and all food system actors. For climate we have scientific targets,
provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), defining ranges of
maximum CO2 emissions allowed to stand a chance of remaining under different levels
of average mean global temperature rise. This has provided the world with estimates of
remaining carbon budgets and of climate risks for societies, which in turn formed the
basis for the Paris Agreement, ratified by 195 nations, of limiting global warming to well
below 2°C with an aim of keeping warming to 1.5°C. However, the 1.5-2°C Paris range
are science-based targets, agreed upon through negotiations and political consensus,
building on the latest scientific understanding. For the global food system, clear
scientific targets currently do not exist. This is a barrier for policy makers and
businesses looking for guidance in achieving their food-related SDG goals and
commitments under the Paris Agreement.
We can conceptualize an integrated human health and environmental sustainability
agenda for the global food system that has clear scientific targets using the concept of a
safe operating space for food systems. The concept of a “safe operating space” for
humanity, proposed by Rockström et al. in 2009, [39] originates from the planetary
boundaries framework and is defined as “global biophysical limits that humanity must
operate within to ensure prosperity for future generations”.
Here we use the planetary boundaries framework as a guide to propose a safe
operating space for food systems that encompasses both human health and
environmental sustainability. This space is defined by scientific targets that set the lower
and upper boundaries (i.e. 100 to 300 g/day of fruit) for various food groups to ensure
human health (see Table 1) and planetary boundaries for food production to ensure a
stable Earth system. This includes the total global amount of cropland use, biodiversity
loss, water use, GHG emissions and N and P pollution that can result from food
production (see Table 3). Together, these boundaries for human health and food
production identify the safe operating space within which food systems should
collectively operate to ensure that a broad set of human health and environmental
sustainability goals are achieved.
The boundaries that define a safe operating space for food systems are not hard-fast
“cliff edges” within which is safety while beyond them lies instantaneous catastrophe.
The Earth system and human health are complex adaptive systems, characterized by
interactions and feedbacks, which science is still trying to unveil and improve precision
on. All scientific targets for a safe operating space for healthy diets and sustainable food
production, are therefore associated with uncertainty. Applying a precautionary and risk
perspective, the boundaries are placed at the lower end of the scientific uncertainty
range, establishing a "safe space" which, if transgressed, pushes humanity into an
uncertainty zone of rising risks [32] . These boundaries should therefore be viewed, not as
9
hard thresholds, but as guides for decision makers on acceptable levels of risk for
human health and environmentally sustainable food production. Operating outside this
space for any Earth system process (e.g. high rates of biodiversity loss) or food group
(e.g. insufficient vegetable intake) increases the risk for harm to human health and the
stability of the Earth system. When viewed together as an integrated human health and
environmental sustainability agenda, “win-win” diets, [24] that fall within the safe operating
space for food systems, will help us to simultaneously achieve global human health and
environmental sustainability goals.
##### **Scope and Limitations of the Commission**
The EAT-Lancet Commission _Our Food in the Anthropocene: Healthy Diets from_
_Sustainable Food Systems_ brings together scientists from several disciplines to assess
the current unsustainability of the global food system and set global scientific targets for
shifting the world to healthy diets and sustainable food production. Given the challenge
of setting scientific targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production, this
Commission focused on the two “end-points” of the complex global food system; final
consumption (healthy diets) and production (sustainable food production). These factors
have disproportionate impact on human health and environmental sustainability. In no
way does this imply that the food system is only about these two “end-points” and that
the problems and solutions lie solely here.
Throughout the report we have used the term “food system” while acknowledging that
food systems are much more than food production and food consumption. More
broadly, they are comprised of _“all the elements (environment, people, inputs,_
_processes, infrastructures, institutions, etc.) and activities that relate to the production,_
_processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food.”_ [15] In fact, by referring to
the “food system” throughout the report, our intention is to emphasize that the Great
Food Transformation that we envision can only be achieved with all actors in all parts of
the food system working collectively toward this transformation.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that the effects of food systems reach beyond
environmental and human health impacts to include social, cultural, economic and
animal welfare consequences and more. However, given the breadth and depth of the
topics discussed in the report, it was necessary to place many important economic and
social issues out of the scope of the Commission. These and other issues must
eventually be considered to achieve healthy diets from sustainable food systems.
This Commission is not setting actionable science-based targets on behalf of any
country, sector or business, nor does it have a mandate to do so. This Commission is
an independent scientific body that is using the latest available science to make a global
assessment of the food system and set global scientific targets for healthy diets and
sustainable food production. In proposing these targets, however, we should not let the
perfect become the enemy of the good.
These targets form the first attempt in providing scientific guidance for a transformation
towards healthy and sustainable food systems. The task moving forward, in the
absence of an IPCC or Paris Agreement for food, is for science to continue to improve
definitions of global scientific targets for human health and environmentally sustainable
food production while business and policy makers begin the work of translating them
into operational science-based targets for various sectors, regions, and countries.
10
The planetary boundaries framework, which serves as a guide throughout the report, is
useful because it expands the definition of sustainable food production to include the
global nature of food production’s environmental impacts, connecting scales from local
to global. It does not, however, provide a ready-made blueprint for translation of global
targets to national and sub-national governments, business, and other local actors. We
frame the need for these global targets in terms of the complex system understanding
that the planetary boundaries framework represents. This is intended to complement
national, sectoral, sociopolitical targets and prioritizations, pointing to the global
environmental context within which these diverse activity areas must fit. This becomes a
first step in connecting a planetary perspective with context-specific levels of action.
In this Commission, we do not propose a magic global fix to the problems discussed.
Instead, the safe operating space for food systems, as defined by this Commission, will
require implementation of a variety and multitude of solutions and innovations to
achieve healthy diets from sustainable food systems. For food production, we avoid
comparison of specific production systems (e.g. organic versus conventional) because
numerous comparisons exist [40,41] and also because debates over specific production
systems and diets can be overly prescriptive and mask the diversity of contexts and
available solutions. For dietary patterns, we give guidance on healthy diets, yet provide
sufficient scope for many global dietary patterns (e.g. vegetarian, pescetarian, etc.) to
be considered. This scope is captured both in the use of broad food groups and intake
ranges that allow for various dietary preferences to be considered. Silver-bullet
solutions neither exist nor would allow diverse users of this analysis to adopt a holistic
concept of a safe operating space for food systems that will be needed.
Lastly, this Commission does not explore various population growth scenarios, such as
the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). A major driver of increasing requirements
for food is a rising global population, which is expected to be between 8.5 to 10 billion
people by 2050. Given this, long term population stabilization will be essential for
achieving healthy and sustainable diets for the world’s population. Universal access to
sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information
and education will be necessary components of this goal. The analysis done by this
Commission follows the SSP2 for population growth, which assumes a “middle of the
road” world where trends broadly follow historical patterns. The assumptions of this and
other SSPs are outlined in more detail in Supplementary Table 1.
##### **Treatment of uncertainty by this Commission**
Few decisions about diet, human health, and environmental sustainability can be made
on the basis of absolute certainty because evidence is incomplete, imperfect, and
continually evolving. As such, certainty must be considered as a continuum. The
estimates presented in this report are based on the best available science, and we
acknowledge that uncertainty exists. Therefore, when possible, we acknowledge this
uncertainty and our confidence in the validity of our findings and qualitatively discuss
this throughout the report “based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of
evidence”. [42] In general, we have a higher level of scientific certainty about the overall
direction and magnitude of the relationships described in this report, while there is
considerable uncertainty around the detailed quantifications. Modeling and sensitivity
analysis provided ways to explore the implications of this uncertainty.
11
#### **Chapter 2 – Healthy Diets**
##### **What is a heathy diet?**
Defining healthy dietary patterns is important for many reasons. For instance, they are
used to provide dietary guidance to a population, to provide assessment and counseling
in clinical settings, to develop practices and policies designed to enhance diet, and to
monitor trends in diet quality for an individual or population. However, practical
considerations make defining a global healthy diet challenging. This includes the
different nutritional needs of people due to age, sex, disease status and physical activity
levels, and needs of vulnerable populations.
A healthy diet should optimize health, defined broadly by the WHO, as being a state of
complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of
disease. [43] Here we focus on diets for generally healthy individuals two years of age and
older. Young children have unique requirements to support rapid growth and
development, but their diets have only minor impacts on food systems because they are
a small proportion of a stable population and have low absolute energy requirements.
Because animal source foods can have important influences on both human health and
environmental sustainability, particular detail will be given to these foods. However, the
conclusions of this chapter are based only on health outcomes. Although important, we
do not consider food safety (i.e. microbial or other forms of contamination).
We define a healthy diet using food groups while taking into consideration nutritional
adequacy [44] because this most directly connects food production and health, and
because most dietary guidelines are based primarily on food groups. However, a focus
exclusively on foods does not incorporate added fats, sugar, salt, and other
constituents, so these will also be considered. The definition of a healthy diet is based
on evidence from controlled feeding studies in humans with intermediate risk factors as
outcomes, observational studies, randomized trials. Where available, we cite systematic
reviews, meta-analyses and pooled analyses of primary data (see Supplementary Table
2 for a summary of cited references). Extensive reviews documenting the importance of
dietary quality have been published elsewhere. [45,46]
The healthy dietary pattern we propose here consists of ranges of intakes for each food
group. This allows for a flexible global application of these criteria, using with the
specific foods and amounts tailored to the preferences and culture of different
populations (see Panel 3).
##### **Uncertainty in estimates of a healthy diet**
As described below, we have a very high level of confidence, based on many
reproducible lines of evidence, that the reference diet that we have defined will meet
nutritional requirements for older children and adults, and result in low rates of NCDs
and overall mortality. The optimal amounts of each food group are often less clear in
part because they depend on intakes of other dietary components. Also, for some food
groups, the relation between intake and health risks is approximately linear, making
specification of an optimal intake difficult. Although a linear positive association would
suggest an optimal intake of zero, an effect of zero intake is not possible to distinguish
from that of a small intake. Further, all the food groups in a diet need to fit within a
constrained total energy intake. To make calculations possible for total nutrient intakes,
health effects, and environmental impacts for overall diets, we provide a number for
12
each food group of the healthy reference diet. We also provide an uncertainty range
(upper and lower limits) which appears to be compatible with optimal health and also
within the consumption ranges of at least some populations globally as this provides
some, but limited, evidence of long term safety. In subsequent analyses, we use
alternative values for some key food groups for sensitivity analyses. Using several
approaches, we provide estimates of the impact of the reference diet on premature
mortality. We anticipate further research will provide greater precision in defining ranges
for optimal intakes of specific food groups and the health impacts of overall diets.
##### **Current status of knowledge**
**Energy and energy balance**
The global average per capita energy intake has been estimated as 2370 kcal per day
at current body weights. [47] There are also gender differences. In a rigorous and large
pooled analysis of US adults, energy intake was approximately 2800 kcal per day for
men, and 2000 to 2200 for women. [48] These numbers would be lower in populations with
lower body size and higher in populations with greater physical activity. Given these
data, we have used a round number of 2500 kcal per day as a basis for different
isocaloric dietary scenarios (i.e. having similar caloric values). Consuming 2500
kcal/day corresponds to the average energy needs of a 70 kg 30-year old male and a
60 kg 30-year old female with a moderate to active level of physical activity. [49] This
figure is higher than the range of 2100-2300 kcal/day used in other analyses that
assumed a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 22 kg/m [2], which is substantially
lower than current reality. Although an average BMI of 22 would be healthier than
current population averages, effect means of reversing the obesity epidemic have not
been identified. Thus, assuming this BMI and a lower energy intake is risky and would
leave little room for public health goals to increase physical activity as this will require
some additional food energy. While the use of different numbers for energy intake would
affect absolute required food production, it would minimally affect conclusions regarding
relative effects of different dietary scenarios on environmental or health outcomes.
##### **Dietary components**
**Major protein sources**
Adequate adult protein intake is considered to be 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight,
which is 56 grams per day for a 70 kg individual or approximately 10% of energy
intake. [50,51] Protein “quality” reflects the amino acid composition of the food source, and
animal sources of protein are of “higher quality” than most plant sources. This is
particularly important for growth of infants and young children, and possibly in elderly
persons who are losing lean mass. [52] However, a mix of amino acids that maximally
stimulates cell replication and growth may not be optimal throughout most of adult life
because more rapid cell replication is a concern for cancer risk [53]
Protein may have indirect beneficial metabolic effects by replacing excessive
carbohydrate intake, especially if this is refined starch and sugar. In a large controlled
feeding trial, [54] replacing carbohydrate isocalorically with protein reduced blood pressure
and improved blood lipids. Similar effects were seen with monounsaturated fat replacing
carbohydrate, suggesting that the benefits were due to a reduction in carbohydrate.
13
Because protein is consumed as part of foods that contain fat and many other
constituents that influence health, it is most useful to consider protein food sources, or
packages, rather than protein _per se,_ when investigating or making food choices.
Although most foods contain some protein, meat, dairy, fish, eggs, legumes including
soy, and nuts including peanuts are relatively high in protein and often considered as
alternatives in many culinary traditions. These major protein sources are also commonly
used to define diets, such as omnivore, vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, or vegan.
In a major review, the 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee [45] concluded
that for persons over two years of age, a balanced vegetarian diet can be a healthy
eating pattern. In the largest prospective study of vegetarian diets, those following
vegan, lacto-ovo, pesco-vegetarian, or semi-vegetarian diets together had a 12% lower
overall mortality risk compared to omnivores; the lowest risk was among pescovegetarians. [55] Using another approach, a plant-based dietary score, giving positive
values to the frequency of plant products (especially healthy plant-based foods, but not
refined grains) and negative values to animal products, was associated linearly with
lower risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. [56,57] These findings suggest
that a shift towards a dietary pattern emphasizing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
and legumes without necessarily becoming a strict vegan, will be beneficial.
Until recently, most analyses of specific foods high in protein and health outcomes have
not specified any comparison food. Thus, in an isocaloric analysis, the comparison
becomes the mix of foods comprising the rest of the diet, to which refined carbohydrates
(e.g., white bread, polished rice, or corn) are typically the major contributors. Despite
this limitation, in a meta-analysis of prospective studies, consumption of processed red
meat (beef, pork or lamb) was associated with greater risk of death from any cause and
from cardiovascular disease (CVD); unprocessed red meat was also weakly associated
with CVD mortality. [58] Although the data were limited, consumption of white meat
(poultry and fish) was not associated with increased mortality. In other meta-analyses,
red meat consumption was associated with risk of stroke, [59] and type 2 diabetes [60] . In
two large studies of total mortality, [61-63] the relation with consumption of red meat, both
processed and unprocessed, was linear and without suggestion of a threshold,
suggesting that optimal intake would be very low (see Figure 1). In a pooled analysis of
three large cohorts, an increment of about 35 grams/day of red meat was associated
with a significant 6% increase in risk of type 2 diabetes. [64]
**Figure 1.** Multivariate relative risk of overall mortality (23,926 deaths) from red meat
consumption during 2.96 million person-years of follow-up of 121,342 men and women. Relative
risks are adjusted for age and major lifestyle and dietary risk factors. (Source: Pan et al. 2012 –

14
More recently, analyses have specifically compared different protein sources in relation
to risk of important health outcomes.
Although red meat consumption was only weakly associated with higher risk of coronary
heart disease (CHD) when compared with the rest of the diet, red meat was more
clearly associated with higher risk of CHD when specifically compared with consumption
of poultry and fish, and especially nuts and legumes. [65] Similar associations have been
seen in analyses with type 2 diabetes, [66] stroke, [67] and total mortality (Figure 2). [61,62] Low
intake of red meat is consistent with traditional Mediterranean diets that have been
associated with exceptional longevity (see Panel 3). In the 1960s, when Greek men
living in Crete had very low rates of coronary heart disease and overall mortality, their
average intake of red meat and poultry combined was 35 grams/day. [68]
**Figure 2.** Percent reduction in risk (95% confidence interval, CI) of major health outcomes
associated with replacing red meat (one serving per day) with alternative protein sources [61,62,65-]
67
Based on evidence related to colorectal cancer, [69] processed red meat (e.g. treated with
salt or other preservatives) was determined by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer review to be a class I carcinogen, and because the data were less consistent,
unprocessed red meat was a classified as a class II carcinogen. [70] Consumption of other
major protein sources during midlife and later has not been clearly related to other types
of cancer, although higher intake of red meat during adolescence [71] and early adult life
72 has been associated with higher risk of breast cancer.
In a recent prospective cohort analysis, protein intakes from specific food sources were
examined in relation to total and cause-specific mortality among 131,000 men and
women followed with repeated measures of diet for up to 32 years. [73] Replacing protein
from animal sources with protein from plant sources was associated with substantially
lower overall mortality. Hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.59-0.75) when 3% of energy
from plant protein replaced an equivalent amount of protein from processed red meat
and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92) from unprocessed red meat.
The higher risks of cardiovascular disease and other outcomes associated with higher
consumption of red meat are likely due in part to the dietary constituents that travel
together with animal sources of protein. In particular, the higher ratio of saturated to
polyunsaturated fat, heat-induced carcinogens, and heme iron, may contribute to the
15
higher risks of cardiovascular disease diabetes, and some cancers seen for red meat
compared with plant sources of protein. [63] Notably, essential polyunsaturated fatty acids
comprise 4% of lipids in beef tallow, 21% in chicken fat, and 40% in salmon fat. [74]
Processed meats are heterogeneous in composition but many contain high amounts of
sodium, nitrates, nitrites, and other preservatives that may add to risks for cancer.
Until recently, most of the available evidence has been from European and North
American studies. In a pooled analysis of Asian cohort studies, poultry and red meat
consumption (mainly pork) was associated with lower all-cause mortality. [75] The
discrepancies between this analysis and those from Europe and North America may be
explained in part by the fact that Asian populations eat much less meat. Also noted by
the authors, the findings could be due to confounding factors because meat may be
more available to individuals of higher socioeconomic status, who also have better
overall health. Most importantly, because many of these countries have only recently
become affluent, the current levels of red meat intake do not reflect long-term intakes,
like for smoking, many decades are likely needed to experience the full health
consequences of high consumption. Among Chinese living in Singapore, which has
been relatively affluent for several decades, red meat consumption has been associated
with risk of type 2 diabetes, [76] consistent with the overall literature on this relationship. [64]
However, in low income populations in which the large majority of energy is from
starchy staples, the addition of meat or other major protein sources is likely to mitigate
micronutrient deficiencies and have metabolic benefits by reducing the high glycemic
load.
**Because intake of red meat is not essential and appears to be linearly related to higher**
**total mortality and risks of other health outcomes in populations that have consumed it**
**for many years, the optimal intake may be zero, especially if replaced by plant sources of**
**protein. Because precision about risk at low intakes is limited, we conclude that a low**
**range of intake, 0 to approximately 28 grams/day, is desirable and have used a midpoint**
**of 14 g/day for the reference diet. As consumption of poultry, compared to red meat, has**
**been associated with better health outcomes we have used a range of 0 to approximately**
**58g/day and a midpoint of 29 grams per day for the reference diet.**
High intake of dairy products, at least 3 servings per day, has been widely promoted in
western counties for bone health and fracture prevention primarily because of their high
calcium content, [77] but the optimal calcium intake remains uncertain. US
recommendations of 1,200 mg/day are derived from balance studies lasting three
weeks or less, [78] which likely reflect transient movements of calcium in and out of bone
rather than long-term requirements. In a World Health Organization review, noting that
regions with low intake of dairy foods and low calcium intake have lower fracture rates
than regions with high dairy consumption [79] concluded that 500 mg/day is adequate and
lower amounts may be adequate in areas with low fracture rates. The UK has
concluded that 700 mg/day is adequate intake. [80] These lower amounts for adequate
intake have major implications for dietary recommendations because many foods
contain modest amounts of calcium, and eating a wide variety of diets with no dairy
foods will include 300 to 400 mg of calcium. With one 250 g serving of milk/day, which
contains about 300 mg of calcium, the reference diet described below contains 718
mg/day of calcium. Although prospective studies have been somewhat heterogeneous,
the overall evidence suggests that among adults no important reduction in risk of
fractures with calcium intakes above 500 mg a day are observed. [81]
16
Data on dairy consumption during childhood and adolescence in relation to long term
health outcomes are limited, but high intake has been thought to be particularly
important because of skeletal growth. However, higher consumption of milk by girls
during adolescence was not associated with hip fracture risk later in life, and in boys
higher milk consumption was associated with higher risk of fractures. [82]
**#### Insert Panel 2 – Animal source foods in Sub-Saharan Africa ####**
The overall evidence from prospective studies does not support an important increase
or decrease in risk of overall mortality or cardiovascular disease with increasing
consumption of dairy foods, [83] although there is likely to be a lower risk of overall and
cardiovascular mortality by replacing dairy foods with nuts and other plant sources of
protein. [73] High milk consumption, likely due to its calcium content, is associated with
lower risk of colorectal cancer [84] but also higher risk of prostate cancer in men, [85]
especially advanced cases. [86] Some evidence suggests that yogurt may reduce risk of
diabetes and weight gain. [87,88] Although low-fat dairy may be preferable to high fat dairy
foods for health, nearly all the fat in milk that is produced remains in the human food
supply, often as butter or cream. Thus, low-fat dairy products will have little overall
effect on population health because the fat is consumed in other forms.
**Because there does not appear to be a clear relationship between intake of milk or its**
**derivatives over the range of 0 to 500 g/day and major health outcomes, and competing**
**risks for some types of cancer, we describe a wide range of intakes as compatible with**
**good health. Because unsaturated plant oils provide lower risks of cardiovascular**
**disease than dairy fat, discussed below, an optimal population diet will usually be at the**
**lower end of this range, and we have used 250 g/day for the reference diet.**
Fish intake has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. [89-91] A unique
benefit of fish is likely due to its high content of omega-3 fatty acids, which play many
essential roles, including being precursors of eicosanoids, a large component of the
central nervous system, a structural element of every cell of the body, and a regulator of
cardiac rhythm. One comprehensive analysis estimated that eating about 2 grams per
week of omega-3 fatty acids in fish, equal to about one or two servings of fatty fish a
week, reduces the chances of dying from heart disease by more than one-third. [89]
Fish that are high on the food chain can bioconcentrate mercury, which has neurologic
toxicity. Mercury levels are high in king mackerel, shark, swordfish, tuna and tilefish,
which should be avoided by pregnant and lactating women. However, adequate intakes
of omega-3 fatty acids are essential for neurodevelopment, and eating more than 2
servings of fish per week or taking fish oil supplements during pregnancy has been
associated with better child cognitive performance. [92] Notably, the issue of mercury
toxicity is largely avoided by consuming small fish, and omega-3 fatty acids from plant
sources (specifically alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) have also been associated with lower
risk of coronary heart disease. [93] The degree to which these can substitute for omega-3
fatty acids from fish for other health outcomes is important to determine, as the plant
sources are more widely available.
**Because approximately 28 g/day of fish can provide essential omega-3 fatty acids and is**
**associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease, we have used this amount for the**
**reference diet. We also use a range of 0 to 100 g/day because higher intakes also appear**
17
**to be compatible with excellent health. Plant sources of ALA can provide an alternative,**
**but the amount required is not clear.**
Eggs are a widely available source of “high quality” protein and other essential nutrients
needed to support rapid growth. Despite past concern about possible increases in risk
of heart disease because of their high content of cholesterol, in large prospective
studies higher consumption of eggs, up to one a day, has not been associated with
higher risk of heart disease, except in diabetics. [94] Interpretation of this lack of
association again must consider that the default comparison in these studies has been
the rest of the typical diet, which is typically far from optimal. Thus, it is likely that isocaloric substitution of plant protein sources for eggs would reduce risk of noncommunicable diseases. On the other hand, in the context of a low income country,
replacing calories from a staple starchy food with an egg can substantially improve the
nutritional quality of a child’s diet and reduce stunting. [95]
**We have used an intake of eggs at about 13 grams/day, or about 1.5 eggs per week, for**
**the reference diet, but higher intake may be useful for low income populations with poor**
**dietary quality.**
Nuts, including peanuts, are nutrient-dense and contain primarily unsaturated fatty
acids, fibre, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytosterols. In observational and
intervention studies nut consumption has favorable effects on blood lipids, oxidative
stress, inflammation, visceral adiposity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. [96,97] In a
meta-analysis of 25 controlled feeding studies, participants were fed an average of 67
grams/day of nuts; blood levels of LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides were reduced in a dose-response manner. [97] In prospective studies, higher
consumption of nuts has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease, [98-101]
type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality. [102,103] In the Spanish PREDIMED trial, those
randomly assigned to eat 30 grams of mixed nuts per day as part of a Mediterranean
diet experienced a 28% reduction in cardiovascular disease. [104] Despite being an energy
dense food, nut consumption strongly induces satiety and is associated with no weight
gain (or reduced weight) and lower risk of obesity in observational studies and clinical
trials. [98]
**As an alternative to red meat, for the reference diet we use an intake of 50 grams/day of**
**nuts, which can include peanuts and tree nuts. These and other plant protein sources are**
**generally exchangeable, although a mix is desirable nutritionally.**
Legumes have reduced LDL-cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure in
controlled feeding studies. [105] In prospective studies, consumption of legumes has been
associated with lower risks of coronary heart disease [65,101] compared with red meat,
although the confidence intervals have been wide due to limited legume consumption.
Soybeans have a relatively high fat content, which is largely polyunsaturated and
includes an important amount of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid. High
amounts of phytoestrogens in soy foods have weak estrogenic effects hypothesized to
block actions of endogenous estrogens, and thus reduce risk of breast cancer and other
hormonally related cancers. Support for this was seen in the Shanghai Women’s Health
Study; soy food consumption during childhood and early adult life was inversely
associated with the risk of premenopausal breast cancer. [106]
18
**We use a total of 50 grams dry weight/day of beans, lentils, peas and 25 grams/day of soy**
**beans.**
Other protein sources such as insects, which are important in some traditional diets, are
being considered for more widespread consumption. [107] These alternatives may have
low environmental impacts but their long term health effects have not been studied.
Cyanobacterium, earlier referred to as “blue-green algae” has traditionally been
consumed in some cultures and has a high protein content and an amino acid profile
comparable to egg. [108] In vitro meat production from cultured animal stem cells is being
developed as an alternative for traditional meat. [109] The health impacts of these novel
foods are unclear, but nutritional composition of in vitro meat is more readily modifiable
than that of conventional meat.
**Major carbohydrate sources (grains and tubers)**
Grains are currently the largest source of energy in almost all diets worldwide. Refining
grains leads to major loss of nutrients and fibre, which has important health implications.
With remarkable consistency, greater intake of whole grains and fibre from grain
sources has been associated with lower risks of coronary heart disease, type 2
diabetes, and overall mortality. [110] Fewer studies have examined total or refined grains in
relation to health outcomes, but refined grains are the major source of high glycemic
carbohydrates, which have adverse metabolic effect and are related to increased risk of
metabolic abnormalities, weight gain, and cardiovascular disease. [88,111] In a recent
prospective international study, conducted mainly in low and middle income countries,
total carbohydrate intake above approximately 60% of energy, was associated with
higher total mortality. [112] In controlled feeding studies, high carbohydrate intake
increases blood triglycerides levels, reduces HDL cholesterol, and increases blood
pressure, especially in individuals with insulin resistance. [54,113,114] This is of great global
significance because declining levels of physical activity and increasing adiposity will
raise insulin resistance and exacerbate these metabolic responses to carbohydrate
intake, and thus increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [115,116]
Potatoes, although containing substantial amounts of potassium and some other
vitamins, provide a large amount of rapidly absorbed carbohydrate, or glycemic load.
Daily consumption has been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, [117]
hypertension [118] and weight gain. [119] Globally, cassava is grown for its resilience in semiarid conditions, but when processed into flour, as is currently being done in Africa, it has
low nutritional value and high glycemic load, which would be expected to increase
metabolic abnormalities, weight gain, and cardiometabolic disease.
**We use these major carbohydrate sources to maintain the target energy intake; available**
**evidence does not support a specific percent of energy intake but keeping this below**
**approximately 60% of energy appears desirable and whole grains are emphasized. Thus,**
**we use 232 grams of whole grains and 50 grams of tubers and starchy vegetables per**
**day (with a limit of 100 grams of tubers/starchy vegetables).**
**Fruits and vegetables**
Fruit and vegetables are a critical source of many micronutrients, including pro-vitamin
A for the prevention of night blindness. Substantial evidence indicates that fruit and
vegetable consumption is also important for cardiovascular disease prevention; the
large majority of benefit is achieved by consuming about 5 servings per day, [120,121]
although higher intakes may provide some benefits. High intake of vegetables reduces
19
blood pressure [122] and is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes. [123] Increasing
intake of most non-starchy vegetables has been associated with less weight gain in long
term follow-up of U.S. adults, [119] but intakes of potatoes, corn, and peas were each
associated with greater weight gain. Higher fruit and vegetable consumption is weakly
related to lower cancer incidence reduction after adjusting for differences in other
lifestyle factors such as smoking and body mass index. [124,125]
**We use intakes of 300 grams/day of vegetables and 200 grams/person/day of fruits, or**
**about 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. This appears to provide the large**
**majority of benefit from these foods if the mix suggested is included.**
**Added fat—total and specific fatty acids and sources of fats**
Added fats from animal sources (e.g., ghee, butter, lard) or plants (e.g., oils,
margarines, shortening) are used in countless recipes and in cooking of many foods;
they can comprise up to about 30% of total energy in some diets. Until recently, most
dietary recommendations suggested reducing or limiting total fat intake to decrease
risks of coronary disease and cancer. However, evidence from both prospective cohort
studies and randomized trials has not supported a benefit of reducing total fat
intake. [126,127] Evidence supports a substantially lower risk of cardiovascular disease by
replacing saturated fat with unsaturated vegetable oils, especially those high in
polyunsaturated fats that include both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. [128-131] [126] Intake
of _trans_ isomers from partially hydrogenated oils is particularly deleterious. [132]
Although intakes of specific fatty acids have been studied extensively in relation to risk
of heart disease, edible oils are always a combination of saturated, mono-unsaturated,
and polyunsaturated fatty acids, depending on the source and processing. Palm and
soybean oil are the most widely consumed oils globally. Palm oil is low in
polyunsaturated (9% vs 60% in soybean oil) and relatively high in saturated fat (52% vs
16% in soybean oil), and is widely consumed in many low- and middle-income
countries. Consistent with this fatty acid composition, consumption of industrially
processed palm oil raises LDL-cholesterol compared to less saturated plant oils. [133] In a
case-control study conducted in Costa Rica, consumption of industrially processed palm
oil was significantly associated with greater risk of myocardial infarction compared to
nonhydrogenated soy bean oil. [134] In many West African countries and parts of Brazil,
minimally processed red palm oil is an important source of provitamin A due to its high
beta-carotene content. Consumption of red palm oil has not been studied in relation to
risk of heart disease and moderate intake may be compatible with low rates of heart
disease.
In the PREDIMED trial, compared to a low-fat diet, a Mediterranean diet high in extra
virgin olive oil reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease and also improved cognitive
function. [104] Rapeseed oil, also called canola oil, is high in monounsaturated fats and
contains a substantial amount of omega-3 fatty acid. In a randomized trial among
survivors of an acute myocardial infarction, a Mediterranean-type diet high in rapeseed
oil greatly reduced risk of recurrent infarction or death. [135] Also, in the most strikingly
successful national program to reduce rates of coronary heart disease (Finland),
rapeseed oil was used to replace dairy fat. [136] Dairy fat has one of the highest
proportions of saturated fatty acids in natural foods. In a detailed prospective analysis
among men and women, dairy fat was associated with greater risk of CHD when
compared isocalorically to unsaturated plant oils. [137]
20
Low-fat diets have been widely promoted as means of losing weight or prevention of
weight gain. Most of the randomized trials to support this conclusion were less than one
year in duration [138] which can be misleading because initial reductions in weight are
often reversed. Also, the intensity of intervention was not balanced in many trials, [139]
which is important because monitoring intake and social support can lead to modest
weight reductions independent of the dietary composition. [140] In a meta-analysis
including over 50 randomized trials lasting at least one year, reductions in dietary fat
were associated with slightly less weight loss compared with the higher-fat control diet
when the intensity of intervention was similar. [141]
**Strong evidence supports consumption of plant oils low in saturated fat as an alternative**
**to animal fats and there is no clear evidence of an upper limit. Thus, a wide range is**
**suggested, and we use 50 grams/day of total added fat with a mix emphasizing**
**predominately unsaturated plant oils.**
**Sugar and other sweeteners**
Sugar, like refined starches, has multiple adverse metabolic effects, at high intakes may
further increase plasma triglycerides. [142] Higher intakes of added sugars, especially
sugar-sweetened beverages, have been associated with weight gain, [143,144] type 2
diabetes, [145] and greater cardiovascular mortality. [146] The WHO recommends that sugar
intake be less than 10% of energy and suggests that reducing to 5% would provide
further benefits; the American Heart Association suggests approximately 5% of energy
or less. [147]
**As sugar has no nutritional value and adverse metabolic effects, we use a limit of 31**
**grams/person/day of all sweeteners, or less than 5% of energy.**
##### **Special considerations**
**Young children and adolescents**
Global and most regional guidelines recommend that infants should be exclusively
breastfed for the first 6 months of life and continued breastfeeding until 2 years of age
and beyond. Benefits include healthy growth and expected cognitive development as
well as lower risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in
life. [148,149] For children 12–23 months, whether breastfed or not, a diet with the daily
inclusion of at least four of seven food groups has been recommended. [150]
Adolescent girls are at particular risk of iron deficiency because of rapid growth
combined with menstrual losses. Menstrual losses have sometimes been a rationale for
increased consumption of red meat, but RDA level supplements, for example as a
multiple vitamin/multimineral preparation, provide an alternative that is far less
expensive and without the adverse consequences of high red meat intake. The WHO
suggests extra iron for female adolescents by supplementation where the prevalence of
anemia is high, with extra caution in malaria endemic regions. [151]
**Healthy diets during pregnancy and lactation**
During pregnancy and lactation, overall food intake is important to support organ,
muscle and bone growth, as well as better physiological and metabolic health. However,
excessive protein intake from animal sources has been associated with a greater risk of
obesity in offspring 20 years later. [152] In a systematic review [153] consumption of dairy
21
foods was inconsistently associated with birthweight or fetal length. Although the
inclusion of some of animal source food in maternal diets is widely considered important
for optimal fetal growth, and increased iron requirement, especially during the third
trimester of pregnancy, limited evidence also suggests that balanced vegetarian diets
can support healthy fetal development, with the caveat that strict vegan diets require
supplements of vitamin B-12. [154] The WHO recommends a healthy diet during
pregnancy as adequate energy, protein, vitamins and minerals, obtained through the
consumption of a variety of foods, including green and orange vegetables, meat, fish,
beans, nuts, whole grains and fruits. [155]
##### **Summary of evidence describing healthy diets**
The combined evidence from controlled feeding studies with intermediate risk factors as
outcomes, long-term observational studies relating individual dietary components and
overall dietary patterns to major disease endpoints and quality of life, [156-158] and
randomized clinical trials supports the conclusion, with a high level of certainty, that
dietary patterns with the following characteristics promote low risk of major chronic
disease and overall wellbeing:
 - Protein sources primarily from plants, including soy foods, other legumes, and
nuts. Fish or alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids several times per week,
with optional modest consumption of poultry and eggs. Low intakes of red meat,
if any, especially processed meat.
 - Fat largely from unsaturated plant sources, with low intakes of saturated fats; no
partially hydrogenated oils
 - Carbohydrates primarily from whole grains with limited intake refined grains and
sugar less 5% of energy
 - At least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, not including potatoes
 - Moderate dairy consumption as an option.
These elements of a healthy diet allow great flexibility because they are compatible with
a wide variety of foods, agricultural systems, cultural traditions, and individual
preferences. These elements can be combined in various types of omnivore, vegetarian
and vegan diets. The findings of benefits in many different populations for overall dietary
patterns, such as the Mediterranean and healthful plant-based diets, document that
healthy dietary patterns can be practically achieved in contemporary populations in
many countries.
Given the above evidence regarding the elements of healthy diets, a healthy reference
diet for 2500 kcal/day is described in Table 1, These intakes provide a starting point for
further analyses to evaluate the potential for feeding the world’s population a healthy
diet while remaining within food production boundaries.

##### **Current dietary patterns compared to reference diet**
Current global food intakes are markedly different from the reference diet in both quality
and quantity (Figure 3). Globally, diets are lacking in fruit, vegetables, nuts, whole
grains, legumes and fish. At the same time, global diets are high in eggs and red meat,
although regional analysis indicates that diets in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa do
not reach the levels suggested in the reference diet (Panel 2). Poultry intake exceeds
the reference amount in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and
Northern Africa, Europe and Central Asia and North America. Dairy consumption
exceeds the reference intake in Europe, Central Asia and North America. Notably, the
ranges in the reference diet allow for shifting of red meat, dairy, eggs and poultry to
additional amounts of legumes, nuts, or fish to accommodate a variety of cultural or
agricultural factors. Overall, the absolute average intake of most healthy foods is still
below the levels in the reference diet, and the amounts of red meat, eggs, and
tubers/starchy vegetables is far above the reference intake, with considerable regional
variation. An analysis of trends in Mexican diets over the past several decades is a
good example of how diets have changed and how current dietary patterns are often far
from the reference diet (Panel 4).

##### **Analyses of total diets: nutrient adequacy and mortality**
A variety of dietary patterns and dietary quality scores have been created by combining
multiple elements of diet, which may have additive or synergistic effects. Although the
methods to develop these scores or indices has varied, those that are similar to the
reference diet (incorporating higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, plant
protein sources, and more unsaturated fats) have consistently predicted lower risks of
cardiovascular risk factors and adverse health outcomes, including total mortality. [54,159-]
169
For this report, we quantified the healthiness of the reference diet in two ways:
assessment of nutrient adequacy and prediction of mortality rates. To assess nutrient
adequacy, we first analyzed the nutrient composition of this diet using data primarily
from US sources (see supplementary Table 3). We also paired country-specific food
composition data and current dietary data to evaluate the effect of moving to the
reference diet on nutrient adequacy. In this analysis, changes to the reference diet
would improve nutrient intakes for most nutrients. Healthy fats (mono and
polyunsaturated fatty acids) are increased, while unhealthy fats (saturated fatty acids)
are reduced. Dietary changes towards the reference diet also improve the adequacy of
most micronutrients, including several critical ones, such as iron, zinc, folate and vitamin
A, as well as low calcium intake in low-income countries. The only exception is vitamin
B12 which is generally low in diets that are low in animal-based ones. Supplementation
or fortification with vitamin B12 (and possibly with riboflavin) might be necessary in
some circumstances. [170]
We analyzed the potential impacts of dietary change on diet-related disease mortality
using three different approaches (see Table 2). The first used a global comparative risk
assessment framework coupled to agricultural production and consumption statistics. [5] Its
risk factors included high consumption of red meat (including beef, lamb, and pork), low
consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and fish, and being underweight,
overweight, and obese. The disease endpoints included coronary heart disease (CHD),
stroke, type-2 diabetes mellitus, site-specific cancers, and an aggregate of other diseases.
Relative risk factors that connect changes in dietary risks to changes in disease mortality
in a dose-response manner were adopted from meta-analyses of prospective cohort
studies. [59,60,69,91,101,103,121,171] Methods for this analysis can be found in the supplementary
information and a full description of the methodology with sensitivity analyses used can be
found in Springmann et al. (forthcoming) [172] We estimated that adopting the reference diet
could lead to about 9.2 million avoided deaths (20% of all deaths among adults) when
accompanied by shifts towards optimal weight levels, and to about 4.7 million avoided
deaths 10% of all deaths among adults) without weight changes. Increased consumption
fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes contributed about one million avoided deaths each,
followed by reductions in red meat consumption (half a million avoided deaths), and
increased fish consumption (about 270,000 avoided deaths).
Using a conceptually similar approach but somewhat different assumptions and data
sources based on dietary surveys and food expenditure data, the Global Burden of
Disease Collaborators estimated that deaths could be reduced by about 18% or 10.8
million deaths per year with universal adoption of a diet similar to the reference diet [173] (
see Table 2). High intakes of sodium and low intakes of whole grains and fruit
contributed most to reduced mortality.
25
The third approach scored both the reference diet and current diets using the
Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, [174,175] which has predicted lower mortality
and disease risks in many populations. [176,177] This index includes lower scores or greater
consumption of trans fat and sugar-sweetened beverages and higher scores for greater
consumption of polyunsaturated fat in addition to variables included in the other
analyses. Sex-specific relative risks relating increments in AHEI scores to total and
disease-specific mortality rates were estimated using two large cohorts with many
repeated assessments of diet (see supplementary information for methods). Applying
these relative risks to current dietary data and disease rates for 118 countries
(excluding only deaths due to trauma and infectious disease), we estimated that
premature deaths could be reduced by about 28%% or 7,400,000 deaths per year by
adoption of the reference diet
**Table 2.** Estimated avoided premature deaths among adults by global adoption of reference
diet.

#### **Chapter 3 – Sustainable Food Production**
##### **An Earth system perspective on sustainable food production**
The need to develop and adopt sustainable food production practices that safeguard
Earth system processes on which both food production and human well-being depend
has become widely recognized. Farming and fishing practices are being developed that
better harness ecosystem services such as pest control, pollination, water regulation,
and nutrient cycling to achieve productivity and resilience, while reducing harmful
environmental impacts. [178] These practices include many approaches such as
26
conservation agriculture, sustainable and ecological intensification, agro-ecological and
diversified farming systems, precision agriculture and organic farming. [179-182]
Most of these practices focus on sustainability at the farm scale, including improvement
of soil carbon concentrations, reduction of nutrient leakage from fields, and enhanced
water use efficiency of crops. Many practices also take a landscape and/or watershed
perspective, in that they aim at improving the management of ecological processes
across the whole landscape in which production is embedded. [178,183] Therefore, most
work on defining environmentally sustainable food production has been conducted at
field to landscape levels. This is important because visible agricultural impacts are
primarily local and differ across the globe, with varying soils, hydroclimates and agroecological zones. Thus, the methods needed for minimizing the environmental impacts
of food production will vary between regions.
We have, however, now entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, [184] where
humanity is the dominating force of change on the planet, and where food production is
the single largest source of environmental degradation and impact on the Earth system.
In light of the global impacts that stem from the food system, there is rising recognition
of the need to adopt an Earth system approach to sustainable food production, which
can no longer be defined only in terms of reducing environmental impacts from local
farming systems. In the Anthropocene, sustainable food production needs to include the
role played by food production in regulating the state of ecosystems, the biosphere, and
ultimately the Earth system. This means considering the complex systemic interactions
from local to global scales, and identifying global boundaries within which the global
food production needs to stay in order to safeguard biophysical processes that support
a stable Earth system.
This widens the perspective of sustainable food production in a critical and
complementary way and the large scale change to global biogeochemical cycles
provides an example. At the field scale, sustainable food production can be defined
from a nutrient perspective (N and P application) as a system with no nutrient leakage
into local groundwater and rivers. However, N and P form part of the agricultural harvest
and are transported to cities or markets often far from where they were applied. Here N
and P ultimately end up either as direct nutrient pollution as food waste or untreated
excreta, or as partial downstream pollution after passing through municipal sewage
treatment. The end result is that a significant percentage of N and P ends up as nutrient
loading in aquatic systems, causing eutrophication of freshwater systems or coastal
zones often far from where it was originally applied as fertilizer. With rising human
interference with the global cycles of N and P in the Anthropocene, an Earth system
perspective on N and P is necessary, which translates not only to reducing
environmental impacts of N and P in farmers’ fields, but also to reducing the total
amount of new reactive N and P being added globally from the atmosphere and mines
into the biosphere.
The planetary boundaries framework is useful in expanding the definition of sustainable
food production to include the global nature of food production’s environmental impacts,
connecting scales from local to global. The framework relates to processes in the Earth
system seen from the planetary scale. A global boundary is not simply the average of
regional impacts and cannot be quantified solely by focusing on regional environmental
assessments. Managing systems and processes, such as those explored by this
Commission, to meet local and regional needs changes planetary behaviour, and in
27
turn, adding the planetary perspective can influence the priorities for action at regional
and local scales. For example, land management decisions in one region can affect
ecosystems and land cover elsewhere through changes in the water cycle and longrange pollution. [185,186] It is important to recognize the dynamic interactions across scales
and between Earth system “components” (land, ocean, atmosphere, biosphere) when
setting targets for transforming the food system. This perspective underpins this
Commission’s initial focus on setting global scientific targets as a necessary first step.
The planetary viewpoint of Earth system science is increasingly focusing on contextspecific insights from systems ecology, enabled by global modelling, worldwide
observation systems and international science partnerships. This frontier research field
points to critical system components and processes that regulate the behavior of the
Earth system, and that are key for global sustainability (see Supplementary Table 4). [187-]
189 This Commission draws upon this field and has identified six systems and processes
that are the main environmental systems impacted by food production, and for which
scientific evidence about their Earth system behavior enables us to provide quantified
scientific targets. These are: climate change, biodiversity loss, land-system change,
freshwater use, and nitrogen and phosphorus flows. [190-193]
We use the planetary boundaries framework as a guide in this report because: 1) the six
systems and processes quantified by this Commission are found within this framework;
2) we are setting global targets and this framework relates to Earth system process at
the planetary scales; 3) this framework has already provided various countries and
sectors with a useful way of holding multiple anthropogenic global environmental
pressures in mind simultaneously. The framework, however, does not deal explicitly
with interactions between the various Earth system processes, although it was devised
with such dynamics firmly in mind.
For each process, we draw upon the available science to propose boundaries that
sustainable global food production must stay within. These boundaries conceptually
define the upper limit of environmental impact for food production at the global scale
that decrease the risk of irreversible and potentially catastrophic shifts in the Earth
system. [190,194]
**#### Insert Panel 5 - Planetary Boundaries ####**
##### **Uncertainty in estimates of sustainable food production**
As described below, the definition of sustainable food production requires setting
planetary boundaries for food production impacts on the climate system, land systems,
freshwater, biodiversity, and nutrient cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus. In this chapter
we present the underlying scientific rationale, literature sources, and assumptions
behind each of the boundaries for our definition of sustainable food production.
However, the boundary levels for each process demarcating the shift to irreversible and
deleterious Earth system change are difficult to set with precision, because of scientific
uncertainty, natural variability and the critical interdependencies of Earth system
processes. In this report, we use uncertainty ranges, based on the scientific literature
and our judgment of the level of confidence, to reflect the uncertainty that exists in
setting global boundaries for sustainable food production (Table 3).
28
#### **Climate change**
##### **Overview**
Anthropogenic emissions of GHGs cause climate change, which leads to disruptions in
the Earth system, such as sea-level rise and an increase in the frequency of extreme
weather events. [195] Food production systems release GHGs (e.g. CO2, CH4, N2O) into
the atmosphere directly, and drive land use change that releases additional carbon
dioxide (CO2) as forests are cleared, wetlands drained, and soils are tilled. However,
with proper management agricultural systems may also provide valuable carbon sinks
that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Food production is a prime source of methane
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) which have respectively 56 and 280 times the global
warming potential (over 20 years) of CO2. [195] Methane is produced during digestion in
ruminant livestock such as cows and sheep, or during anaerobic decomposition of
organic material in flooded rice paddies. Nitrous oxide mainly arises from soil microbes
in croplands and pastures and is influenced by soil fertility management, such as
fertilizer application. Carbon dioxide is released on agricultural land from the tillage of
soils and during burning to clear land of plants, soil organic matter and agricultural
residues, and from burning fossil-fuels by farm machinery and in transport of agricultural
products. It is also released when converting natural ecosystems, especially forests, to
agriculture.
The biological processes that produce emissions are intrinsic to crop and livestock
production and some level of GHGs will always be generated by biological processes
intrinsically associated agriculture. Therefore, while we can and must set high ambitions
for anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions (to meet the Paris climate target of < 2°C),
we cannot expect to fully eliminate all GHG emissions (i.e. CH4, N2O) related to food
production and a minimum threshold level of residual emissions has not yet been
quantified. Here we propose a boundary for GHG emissions from food production,
which we assess is both necessary and hard to reduce further, at least until 2050, if we
want to achieve both healthy diets for everybody on the planet and the Paris Climate
Agreement.
##### **A global carbon budget**
The Paris Agreement frames the political and scientific consensus to keep the global
mean temperature increase by 2100 under 2°C and if possible closer to 1.5°C, relative
to 1861–1880 temperatures. To stay within this boundary, there is a maximum amount
of GHGs that can still be emitted (i.e. the carbon budget). This translates to a remaining
total global emissions budget from 2011 onwards of approximately 800 GtCO2 for CO2
or 1000 GtCO2-eq for CO2, CH4 and N2O combined These estimates are from the fifth
assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
and represents the most stringent mitigation pathway (representative concentration
pathway - RCP2.6) and describes a 66% chance for limiting global warming <2°C.
The majority of scenarios underlying the RCP2.6 pathway involve overshooting the
carbon budget initially and then compensating, particularly from 2040 onwards by
massive removals of CO2 from the atmosphere. [196] A variety of negative emissions
technologies and actions could theoretically deliver these removals with the most
commonly promoted approaches being carbon capture and storage (CCS) and
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). BECCS, however, may have
major implications for land use and food security (Panel 6).
29
**#### Insert Panel 6 – Negative emissions ####**
Figure 4 summarizes recent data [37] on likely requirements, in terms of global GHG
emission trajectories, to reach the Paris climate target. For a 66% probability of
maintaining <2°C global warming, global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning and
industrial processes must peak no later than 2020 and then reach a residual of ~5
GtCO2 yr [-1] by 2050. Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions,
dominated by agricultural expansion and agricultural land use emissions, will have to
transition by 2050 from a net global source (currently ~5 GtCO2 yr [-1] ) to a net carbon
sink (-10 GtCO2 yr [-1] ) by 2100.
Given this, how food is produced is central to whether or not the Paris climate target of
<2°C is attainable. This will involve minimizing non-CO2 emissions, in particular CH4
and N2O, from food production and transforming the world’s food production systems
from net carbon sources to net carbon sinks. In addition, achieving the Paris target will
also require the rapid global decarbonisation of the energy system.
**Figure 4.** Assessment of global emission trajectories to have a chance of reaching the Paris
climate target of < 2° C global warming, with a particular focus on the role of the global food
system. Data from IPCC AR5 (RCP2.6 data for N2O and CH4) and Rockström et al. [37] (for fossilfuel emissions, LULUCF, and biosphere carbon sinks).
##### **Current status of emissions associated with food production**
Estimates of agriculture’s net GHG emissions vary widely depending on which
subcategories are included: (1) emissions of non-CO2 gases (CH4 and N2O) from
agricultural production are estimated to be 5.0-5.8 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] [197] ; (2) CO2 emissions
from conversion of natural ecosystems, especially forests, to croplands and pastures is
estimated in the range of 2.2-6.6 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1], [198] as well as a small amount from
biomass burning of around 0.3 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] ; [197] (3) CO2 emissions from energy use in
agricultural machinery are estimated at 1.0 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] . [199] Given this, the total
30
current estimate of all GHG emissions as a result of food production is in the range of
8.5 to 13.7 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] . Total emissions from food production have been relatively
stable since 1990, growing at less than 1% per year, as increases in production have
been offset by decreasing emissions intensity per unit of product. [197,199]
##### Scientific target for GHG emissions from food production - Global GHG emissions of CH4 and N2O kept at or below 5 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1]
Determining what the maximum allowed share of the remaining global carbon budget
should come from food production is complex, and any scientific target will depend on
viability and costs of emission reductions in other sectors. In light of these important
concerns, what we present here is a suggested global ‘budget’ for GHG emissions from
food production by 2050 to ensure environmental sustainability. This includes only
emissions of non-CO2 gases (CH4 and N2O) and assumes CO2 emissions from other
sources have been reduced to zero.
We propose that global GHG emissions from food production be kept at or below 5 Gt
CO2-eq yr [-1] in 2050. This scientific target of 5 Gt GHG emissions from food production
represent nearly half of the allowable global emissions from all sources in 2050
consistent with the RCP2.6 pathway and a 2°C temperature rise. This proportion of food
production’s share of global GHG emissions by 2050 is larger than today’s share which
roughly accounts for one quarter of total global GHG emissions.
This scientific target of 5 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] GHG emissions from food production is based
on the combined CH4 and N2O emissions projections of 4.7 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] from food
production which is derived from runs of three integrated assessment models [200] : IMAGE
4.28, MESSAGE 4.41, and GCAM 5.30 under RCP2.6 reported in Wollenberg et al. [200]
and corroborated for IMAGE by van Vuuren et al. [201] Integrated assessment models
generate these results by running sub-models of climate systems, socio-economics,
energy use, land use and other sub-systems, to allocate emissions reductions most
cost-effectively across sectors and across GHGs. The RCP2.6 pathway projects that
CH4 from food production will diminish gradually throughout the 21 [st] century whereas
N2O emissions are expected to plateau after 2050. [201,202] In addition to CH4 and N2O
emissions, biomass burning on agricultural land, which releases CO2, is expected to
contribute an additional 0.7 Gt of CO2 in 2050 under RCP2.6. [201,202] Combining these
three gases gives a total of 5.4 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] . Given the uncertainties associated with
emissions estimates we set the boundary to be 5 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] with an uncertainty
range of 4.7-5.4 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1] .
Achieving the scientific target for GHG emissions from food production is based on two
fundamental assumptions. First, there will be zero CO2 emissions associated with land
clearance for food production. If land use change (e.g. deforestation and other land
conversion) for food production is reduced to zero, then it follows that there will no
longer be GHG emissions from this source. This is an ambitious goal that goes beyond
the RCP2.6 pathway for CO2 emissions associated with land use change. Second, there
will be zero net emissions from energy use in food supply chains. Greenhouse gas
emissions from fossil fuel use in food production are formally ascribed to the energy
sector, not the agriculture sector, in the IPCC and other emissions-accounting
frameworks. By 2050, under RCP 2.6, the energy sector is projected to have small net
negative emissions of -1.2 Gt CO2-eq yr [-1], due to negative emissions technologies.
31
More recent analyses also propose a global transition to clean energy by 2050, bringing
emissions from energy use in all sectors to zero. [37]
#### **Freshwater use**
##### **Overview**
Food production is the world's single largest water consuming sector [1] . Agriculture
consumes freshwater through rain on 84% of cropped land, and irrigation (i.e. water in
freshwater lakes, rivers and aquifers) on the remaining 16%. [203] Seventy percent of all
global water withdrawals are used for irrigation. This share of water withdrawals for food
production varies between regions, from 21% in Europe to 82% for Africa. Overall,
water consumption for food production has more than doubled between 1961 and
2000. [204]
Water functions as the bloodstream of the biosphere. [205] It underpins all biomass growth
and determines the extent and distribution of biomes and ecosystems. Water drives
nutrient cycles, including flushing and leaching of nutrients and pollutants (heavy metals
and plastics). The hydrological cycle is strongly coupled to climate systems, including
moisture feedback dynamics determining regional precipitation. [206] In this report,
however, we focus on the quantity of water needed to maintain minimum environmental
water flow levels in watersheds and river basins, and thus sustain ecosystem health and
the benefits that society receives from these systems.
Environmental flows are the “quantity, quality and timing of water flows required to
sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well-being
that depend on these ecosystems” (Brisbane Declaration [207] ). They are the result of
upstream freshwater partitioning of rainfall into evaporation or runoff and are also
influenced by withdrawals of water for irrigation or other uses. For example, irrigated
agriculture upstream, will lead to larger withdrawals of water, which in turn leads to
lower environmental water flow levels in rivers. This can affect downstream ecological
functions of importance for society, such as drinking water supplies, fisheries, nutrient
retention, and pollution control.
To understand the effects of water withdrawals on environmental flows, it is important to
distinguish between consumptive water use and non-consumptive water use.
Consumptive water use refers to water that is removed from a watershed by
evapotranspiration (loss of water from direct evaporation or plant transpiration), thereby
directly reducing environmental water flows. Non-consumptive water use refers to water
use that flows back to rivers and aquifers after use. Most irrigated water ends up as
consumptive water use making it unavailable for other uses in the watershed, while a
smaller part returns directly to watersheds as surface or groundwater runoff. As much
as 75-84% of global consumptive water use can be attributed to agriculture. [204,208]
The minimum volume of water that needs to remain in rivers to sustain ecological
functions is called environmental flow requirements (EFR). The EFR is defined as the
minimum water volume, timing, and quality needed to maintain environmental function
and downstream benefits. As such, EFR defines the allowable upstream withdrawals
32
and consumption that sets the basin-scale boundaries for water use that ensures
adequate environmental flows in watersheds. The hydrological dynamics (such as lowflow and high-flow values) and the ecological context of individual watersheds and river
basins influence the EFR values. [209] As such, water is best analyzed regionally at the
basin level.
##### Scientific target for freshwater use from food production - Global consumptive water use kept at or below 2500 km [3] yr [-1]
The original planetary boundary for water was proposed as 4,000 km [3] yr [-1 ] based on a
global analysis not accounting for the distinct hydro-ecological contexts and EFR
requirements of individual river basins. [194] This boundary did not include water use by
crops in rain-fed agriculture nor water loss through evaporation from dams. [210] Some
have argued that this boundary is too high, and should be lower. [211] Gerten et al. [212]
refined the water boundary with a global analysis at the scale of river basins of EFR
requirements quantifying available freshwater withdrawals if EFR requirements were to
be respected. Gerten et al. offers a more conservative global freshwater planetary
boundary of 2,800 km [3] yr [-1] for all human use including for food production. [212] Current
consumptive water use by all human activities has been estimated to be in the range of
1800-2100 km [3] yr [-1], of which food production uses between 1400-1800 km [3] yr [-1] . [204,208]
For setting a global scientific target for consumptive water use from food production, we
have chosen to adopt the more conservative planetary boundary of 2,800 km [3] yr [-1] . [212]
Agriculture's current share of global consumptive water use is 75%-84%. [213] If this is
maintained, food production’s share of the planetary boundary for freshwater would be
2,100-2,352 km [3] yr [-1] . Given that food production is fundamental to human well-being
and that closing yield gaps in many parts of the world is essential to feeding a global
population, we suggest that the agricultural sector should be allowed a larger future
allocation of the overall planetary boundary. Setting the agricultural share of the 2800
km [3] yr [-1] planetary boundary to 90% by 2050, rather than the current 75-84%, yields a
global water boundary for food production of approximately 2,500 km [3] yr [-1] . However,
recognizing the uncertainty in these estimates, we have adopted Gerten et al. [212]
uncertainty range of 1100-4500 km [3] yr [-1] and applying a 90% allocation for food
production gives us an uncertainty range rounded to 1000-4000 km [3] yr [-1] .
We believe increasing food production’s share of the global consumptive water use to
90% is feasible given that many technological solutions currently exist to limit
consumptive water use in industry and domestic sectors. Wada et al. [204] find that
consumptive water losses in industry are 20% of water withdrawals in high income
countries with better technologies, but 35% in middle-income countries and 60% in low
income countries. This suggests that significant reductions are possible through greater
adoption and use of existing technologies. In food production, consumptive water use is
unavoidable since plants transpire to grow and it is very difficult to have zero net
evaporation over soil. Management practices can reduce evaporative losses through
better irrigation technologies, however some losses will remain unavoidable simply due
to plant growth.
##### **Regional Considerations**
The global estimate of consumptive water use masks significant regional variations, with
some regions well within the boundary and others facing severe water shortages. These
33
are particularly true in arid regions which are chronically short of water and where basin
scale EFR are systematically overtaken by irrigation. These regions include specifically
West Asia and North Africa, parts of the Andean region in South America, portions of
the West Coast of the US, the Indo-Gangetic plains and the Yang-Tse basin (Figure 5).
This highlights the fact that water use is an issue at the regional and river-basin level
and local and regional boundaries need to be set depending on their specific EFRs. The
global boundary proposed here is an aggregate of water use by region. In addition to
using EFRs as local and regional level boundaries, Gleick and Palaniappan (2010)
propose using peak nonrenewable water and peak ecological water, where the total
costs of ecological disruptions from water use exceed the total value provided by
humans, as indicators of freshwater withdrawal and use.
Models of global water use indicate that up to 87 countries (depending on the
population scenario) will likely exceed their EFR by 2050; up from 66 countries in 2000.
Thirty of these countries are required to import food because of water limitations to local
food production. [214] These countries are mainly located in North Africa and the Arabian
Peninsula where irrigation is the main source of freshwater. Over-consumption of
freshwater is most acute in low-income countries or in densely populated less
industrialized nations. [212]
There will be an increasing need for trade in water-intensive products (virtual water) to
the world’s water limited basins to maintain extraction below EFRs. Assuming an ideal
trade scenario, the integrity of specific water basins could be maintained through trade.
Surplus basins around the world could deliver water to deficit basins by trading waterintensive food products (Panel 11). This would require unimpeded food trade and all
countries to possess sufficient foreign currency to purchase food. In the current political
climate, however, there is high pressure towards enhancing food sovereignty (or selfreliance) through local food production. This places tremendous pressure on water
resources especially in arid and semi-arid developing countries. Low-income nations
that are unable to trade because of political or economic reasons are most at risk.
**Figure 5.** Transgression of the allowed monthly water withdrawals as % of mean monthly river
flow (fraction of maximum allowed level) during months that show such an exceedance [190] . For
example, green (within planetary boundary for water use) means that average exceedance in
the respective months is still below the uncertainty range (Source: Steffen et al. [190] )
34
There is good evidence, however, that increases in water productivity (more crop per
drop) of 20% are possible and could help to alleviate water stress in many regions of
the world. De Marsily and Abarca-del-Rio [215] review numerous sources and find this
value within reach, especially when done with increases in crop yield, which in turn
results in an increase in water productivity. [216,217] These values confirm the findings of
Cai and Rosegrant [218] who estimated increases in water productivity of 33% for rice and
up to 50% for cereals by 2025 resulting from improvements in crop yields and water-use
efficiency. Similarly, Jägermeyr et al [219] estimated that improvements in crop water
productivity of 9-15% are possible by replacing surface irrigation systems with sprinkler
and drip systems, and significantly larger improvements can be achieved in the Indus
river basin and other low efficiency irrigation zones.
#### **Nitrogen and phosphorus flows**
##### **Overview**
Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are nutrient elements, vital to both structure and
metabolism of living organisms on land and in the oceans. N and P are both critical to
plant growth and their natural availability limits plant growth in most terrestrial
ecosystems. Supply of N and P fertilizers to croplands is essential for maximizing crop
yields and will continue to be necessary for feeding a growing global population. [220-223]
The production, application and trade in fertilizers plays a central role in disrupting
global N and P cycles. Excessive N and P application in food production has substantial
consequences, notably in runoff into streams and rivers driving the eutrophication of
freshwater and marine ecosystems and subsequent development of hypoxic (oxygenfree) conditions causing fish dieback and other environmental harm. [19,224] Though mostly
driven by excessive fertilizer application in food production, human sewage is also an
important point source. Atmospheric N deposition, usually carried from rain, snow, or
fog to the earth’s surface, is a third important contaminant source, particularly in
countries with high NOx (i.e. NO and NO2) and NH3 emission rates. [225]
In addition to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems, nitrogen application in agriculture
can have several other environmental and health impacts, including: (i) eutrophication of
terrestrial ecosystems, reducing their biodiversity and altering ecosystem functions [226-228]
(ii) acidification of water and soils by ammonia (NH3) emissions, [229,230] (iii) nitrous oxide
(N2O) emissions, which is a potent greenhouse gas, [231] (iv) groundwater contamination
by nitrates (NO3) with negative impacts on human health, [232,233] and (v) creation by NH3
of fine atmospheric particulate matter and its harm to human health [234] . Agricultural N
addition also drives NOx emissions which are a major source of particulate and ozone
pollution [235,236] and contribute to reduced crop yields [237,238] .
Nitrogen fertilizer is created using the Haber-Bosch industrial process to convert
plentiful non-reactive nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (NH3). This process is highly energy
intensive and associated with substantial levels of GHG emissions. Phosphorus
fertilizer, on the other hand, is a non-renewable resource that is mined from a finite
number of phosphate rock deposits. At current and projected rates of exploitation, these
deposits are estimated to run out within 50 to 100 years. [239]
35
##### **Nitrogen and phosphorus for people and planet**
A grand challenge for humanity is to harmonize the maximum allowed N and P loading
into the biosphere to maintain a stable Earth system, with the necessary amounts of N
and P required to feed humanity. [240] Estimates of “human needs” show that feeding
nearly 10 billion people by 2050 on current cropland will require higher annual global
applications of N and P fertilisers [241] that exceed the planetary boundaries for N (62-82
Tg N yr [-1] ) and P (6.2-11.2 Tg P yr [-1] ).
However, the Earth system approach taken here, where what counts is the aggregate
impact caused by food production on the biosphere, opens up significant opportunities if
practices are adopted where (i) more food is produced per unit of N/P input, (ii) loss of
nutrients is reduced to a minimum and, in particular, (iii) nutrients are recycled, not only
on farmers' fields, but also at system level, e.g., in the rural-urban interface. Experience
shows that there are ample opportunities to reduce environmental impacts of food
production by eliminating nutrient overuse and run-off into aquatic systems, while still
allowing an increase in food production. [242]
Closing nutrient loops and using N and P more efficiently is one opportunity for
producing more food without releasing more reactive N and P into the biosphere. This
includes applying the right type of fertilizer, with the right amount, at the right time, and
right place. It also involves efforts to recover nutrients (i.e. recycling) in usable form from
places in the food system where they concentrate, such as sewage treatment plants,
food processing plants, compost operations, and livestock production facilities. Adopting
a closed loop system to global food production recycles N and more importantly P within
food systems, keeping it out of the biosphere and decreasing the environmental impact.
Improved nutrient-use, and reuse efficiency can simultaneously permit increased global
application of N and P to close yield gaps (i.e., the difference between attainable and
actual yields) while reducing the total global need for new N and P fertilizer synthesis.
Another opportunity arises from the redistribution of N and P use to close yield gaps. On
a global scale, N and P fertilizer application is highly unevenly distributed ranging from
N and P inputs insufficient to close yield gaps to excessive surplus application in many
developed and rapidly growing economies. [243] Many developed nations apply N in
excess, having N application rates much higher than needed to obtain current yields. In
contrast, many developing countries have yields that are only ½ to ¼ of those that could
be obtained with appropriately-increased and well-timed fertilizer applications. [244,245]
##### Scientific target for nitrogen use from food production - Global nitrogen application kept at or below 90 Tg N yr [-1]
Nitrogen fluxes (net movement of N) to air and water react directly to increases in N
input because N does not build up in soils. Therefore, the more N that is added to
croplands the more N losses that can be expected due to leaching and runoff into
aquatic systems, volatilization to the air, and crop removal, which accounts for the
majority of N that leaves the soil system. This direct link between inputs and losses was
the basis for the critical anthropogenic N input calculation by De Vries et al. [241], which is
the amount of N that can be applied (from fixation by legumes and fertilizer) globally for
food production without causing eutrophication. The critical N input (i.e. N application) is
a fraction of the current global N input, which currently exceeds planetary boundaries.
36
The N boundary for global food production is derived by multiplying current estimated
industrial (from Haber-Bosch) and biological N fixation with mean fractions varying
between 0.50 and 0.67 of current global N application. These mean fractions relate to
the percentage of reductions in current global N application necessary to keep N
concentrations in runoff at safe levels varying between 1 and 2.5 mg N [-1] . [241] Current
total global N application is estimated to be approximately 130 Tg N yr [-1] . [241,246,247 ]
Multiplying 130 Tg N yr [-1 ] with 0.50 and 0.67 leads to a range of 65-87 Tg N yr [-1], with the
proposed global N application boundary for food production set at 90 Tg N yr [-1] and an
uncertainty range rounded to 65-90 Tg N yr [-1] . This is slightly higher than the boundary
proposed by Steffen et al. (2015) who used a total global N application of 121.5 Tg N yr [-]
1, which may be based on an underestimation of fertilizer use.
The proposed N boundary from food production, may still be an underestimate given
that it is based on current global patterns of N use, which includes overuse in some
areas and underuse in others. In deficit areas, additional N input to increase crop yield
is possible without negatively impacting the environment. In addition, the N boundary
does not consider efficiency gains through closing N loops. If global redistribution of N
and closing N loops are both considered, a higher global use of N might be possible
without exceeding the N boundary for food production. We therefore include an upper
uncertainty range of 90-130 Tg N yr [-1] that considers an increase in N fertilizer [244] use if
global redistribution of N and closing N loops are adopted. This upper value of 130 Tg N
yr [-1] is a “human needs” estimate for the amount of N that may be needed to feed a
global population of nearly 10 billion people.
##### Scientific target for phosphorus use from food production - Global phosphorus application kept at or below 8 Tg P yr [-1]
The planetary boundary of 6.2 Tg P yr [-1] (6.2-11.2 Tg P yr [-1] ), originally proposed by
Carpenter and Bennett [248] and adopted by Steffen et al. [190] was a regional-level and
short-term boundary to avert widespread eutrophication in regional watersheds. This
boundary applied primarily to global croplands given that most P addition to watersheds
is from fertilizer use. This boundary is based on the total global flow of P in erodible soil
to freshwater systems minus current weathering rates. A criticism of this approach is
that it assumes that soil erosion is the principal source of P to freshwater systems.
Phosphorus that is moved off the field in crops, consumed by animals and humans, and
subsequently excreted as manure and human waste and ending up as P inputs to
freshwater systems are excluded. Therefore, this may drive an overestimate of the longterm global P boundary of sustained flow of 11 Tg P yr [-1] (11-100 Tg P yr [-1] ) from
freshwater systems into the ocean.
De Vries [249] developed a global phosphorus-flow model for food production that takes
into account some of the criticisms of the original approach used by Carpenter and
Bennett [248] but did not factor in other fluxes such as weathering rates. In it, the external
acceptable global P input from food production to the biosphere is determined by the
long term (thousands of years) acceptable accumulation of P in soil and sediments and
inputs to surface water (oceans) due to runoff and leaching that leave P concentration
equal to a critical threshold for eutrophication. The boundary is affected by uptake and
excretion of P by humans to freshwater systems (stored in sediments) and recycling of
human waste to soils (stored in soils). It assumes full P recycling of animal manure.
Using this approach and assuming no human waste recycling leads to a long-term P
37
global input range from food production of approximately 6-12 Tg P yr [-1] . This new
calculation is similar to the Carpenter and Bennett [248] input range. Given this, we
propose the global long-term P application boundary from food production to be 8 Tg P
yr [-1] with an uncertainty range of 6-12 Tg P yr [-1] .
This P boundary may also be an underestimate given that it does not consider the
critical impact of improving P use efficiency through closing P loops through recycling
and reducing point source P loads. It also does not consider global redistribution of P
use from over-applying to under-applying regions. This is important because unlike
nitrogen, P is adsorbed into the soil and can build up and be held in soil P stocks.
Increasing soil organic matter and carbon stored in soils increases the capacity of soils
to store P. Phosphorus leaching and runoff to surface waters occurs when P stocks in
soils are saturated and P input as fertilizer is greater than the amount of P removed
during cultivation and harvest. When soils are P deficient (i.e. stocks are not saturated)
additional inputs of P are possible and will increase yields with minimal environmental
harm. Together, these considerations effectively increase the P boundary.
Currently, global P stocks are deficient in some areas, while saturated in others. To
increase crop yields, global phosphorus stocks should be saturated globally, and P
application should maintain P saturation by replacing P that is removed during
cultivation and harvest. Doing this would close yield gaps which is necessary for feeding
nearly 10 billion by 2050. We estimate that this can be accomplished through short term
time-bound (over a few years) global P application of 16 Tg P yr [-1] targeting P deficit
soils and therefore propose an upper input range of 8-16 Tg P yr [-1], while maintaining a
P boundary of 8 Tg P yr [-1] . This can be achieved by recycling 50% of human waste and
reapplying the recycled P to croplands. This will become even more important as the
global population increases by over 2 billion people by 2050.
#### **Biodiversity loss**
##### **Overview**
Food production is particularly dependent on biodiversity, and inversely, biodiversity
conservation is fully dependent on food production. The diversity and richness of all
living organisms on land and in water, ranging from animals, trees, plants to microorganisms and phytoplankton, is necessary for the health and stability of ecosystems [250-]
252 and in turn for the productivity and resilience of food production systems. This
functional value of biodiversity is often poorly understood and radically undervalued. [253-]
256 Biodiversity generates critical ecosystem services necessary for human well-being
that include support to food production, pollination, pest control, heat regulation, carbon
sinks, and moisture feedback for rainfall amongst others. The nutritional quality,
protective attributes, and flavors of most plant foods is itself a function of evolutionary
interactions between species. [257]
Despite this, the fundamental role of biodiversity in the productivity and resilience of
food production is colliding with the observational evidence that we have entered the 6th
mass species extinction on Earth, losing species at a rate 100 - 1000 times greater than
background Holocene rates. [258-260] Biodiversity is decreasing at an alarming rate, as
measured through rates of species extinction [259,260], local changes in community
composition, declines in population abundance [259] and reduced biodiversity
intactness [193] . This loss of biodiversity, including agricultural biodiversity (Panel 7), is an
38
increasing threat to the Earth system, [250,252] and global food security and has the
potential to fundamentally undermine our ability to sustainably feed a global population
of nearly 10 billion people by mid-century.
**#### Insert Panel 7 – Agricultural biodiversity ####**
##### **Food production as a driver of biodiversity loss**
Multiple human actions contribute to biodiversity loss. Terrestrial and aquatic habitat
loss, habitat fragmentation, climate change, chemical pollution, invasive species and
unsustainable harvest of wild species have been identified as primary drivers. [254,261]
However, habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly through the human appropriation
of land for food production, is the single greatest current driver of biodiversity loss. [254,262]
Based on the IUCN classification of bird and mammal extinction risks, 80% of the
mammal and bird species that are threatened with extinction have agriculture as a
cause of those threats (Figure 6).
**Figure 6.** Relative impact of agriculture and other activities on mammals and bird species
threatened with extinction based on IUCN extinction risks. Source: Tilman et al. [263]
Increasing crop yields is often cited as a method for halting or limiting land expansion
for agriculture and its detrimental impact on biodiversity. However, increasing crop
yields has often led to excessive fertilizer and pesticide applications, and inefficient
irrigation which have significant detrimental effects on local biodiversity loss through
their impact on terrestrial and aquatic systems, notably contamination by excess
nutrients, and reduced environmental flows in aquatic systems as discussed in the
previous section. Taken together, expansion and to a lesser extent excessive
(unsustainable) intensification of agriculture are key drivers of biodiversity loss. [264]
##### Scientific target for biodiversity loss from food production - Global biodiversity loss kept at or below 10 E/MSY
Current extinction rates [265] and population declines [259] are orders in magnitude higher
than Holocene background rates of approximately 1 extinction per million species per
year (E/MSY). It is unknown how many species can be lost while still maintaining our
ability to feed humanity, but each additional species lost represents a fundamental
39
reduction in resilience and capacity to respond to environmental change. [266] A precursor
to extinction is the reduction of species’ population sizes and local extinctions. For
example the loss of 75% of insect biomass [267] over 30 years and 30% of farmland birds
over 15 years, as noted in recent European studies, occur long before global extinctions
and severely impact biodiversity’s capacity to support food production, gene flow and
other ecosystem services.
A background extinction rate of 1 E/MSY across many taxa has been proposed as a
benchmark against which to assess the impacts of human actions. [260] There is a high
degree of uncertainty over what level of higher-than-background extinctions the Earth
system can tolerate, which is distinct from, and less conservative than intrinsic
biodiversity value benchmarks which argue for zero species loss. This uncertainty
therefore justifies both a high uncertainty range and our proposed scientific target of <10
E/MSY, which is within one order of magnitude greater than the background extinction
rate and the same as put forth by Steffen et al. [190] However, given that we do not know
what levels of, or types of, biodiversity loss may possibly trigger irreversible changes to
the Earth system, the boundary from food production, in principle, should be set at a
rate of loss no greater than the historical background rate. We suggest, therefore, an
uncertainty range of 1-80 E/MSY, with the lower value being equal to the background
extinction rate and the upper value being agriculture’s share of impact on species
decline (80%) of the upper value of the uncertainty range (100 E/MSY) proposed by
Steffen et al. [190]
While E/MSY is a logical metric for measuring biodiversity loss, several caveats are
important to recognize. First, E/MSY is typically measured on geological timescales
rather than on the much shorter ecological time scales of global environmental
conventions including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). However, given
that early indications of global extinctions are becoming observable in ecological
timescales is cause for significant concern requiring urgent action. Second, regional
reductions in species populations [259] and local extinctions both serve as a precursor to
global extinction. These are better suited for indicating potential loss of global
biodiversity and concomitant ecosystem services [259] and can be measured using
biodiversity intactness. Third, not all species have the same measurable impact on
Earth system processes, and thus species loss may not capture the extent to which an
individual species lost affects global processes [268] . Despite these limitations, models
based on well-documented species area relationships (SAR) have recently been used
to extrapolate the extent to which anticipated land conversion could contribute to
species loss. [269-271] As such, we maintain E/MSY as the appropriate metric for
measuring global biodiversity loss from food production, but suggest measures of
biodiversity intactness and Half Earth as strategies to guide action.
#### **Land-system change**
##### **Overview**
Globally, the total net area devoted to food has remained relatively constant since the
mid-20 [th] century. This masks the real picture, however, as substantial reductions in
agricultural land have occurred in the temperate regions of Europe, Russia and North
America, while substantial agricultural land expansion has occurred in the biodiversity
rich tropics. Food production is currently the largest driver of land-use and land-use
change, mainly through the clearing of forests and burning of biomass. Between 2000 to
40
2014, Brazil lost on average 2.7 million hectares (ha) of forest per year, the Democratic
Republic of Congo on average 0.57 million ha per year with a 2.5 factor increase since
2011, and Indonesia lost on average 1.3 million ha per year with 40% occurring in
primary forest. [272] This land-system change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss and
GHG emissions (see section on GHG emissions) and undermines the other biophysical
processes that regulate the state of the Earth system.
To maintain a stable Earth system in the Anthropocene, the land use challenge is to
safeguard critical terrestrial and marine biomes that regulate the state of the planet and
provide ecological functions that support food production. The original control variable
for land-system change in Rockström et al. 2009 was cropland use, i.e., the maximum
allowed conversion of natural terrestrial ecosystems into cropland to safeguard critical
biomes. This was set at no more than 15% of global ice-free land surface, of which
approximately 12% was under cultivation a decade ago [273] and which allowed for
approximately 3% expansion. The updated control variable in Steffen et al. [190] was
shifted to a more direct estimate of the minimum extent required to safeguard critical
biomes as intact ecosystems.
Currently, approximately 51% of the global land surface can be classified as intact
ecosystems with a Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) of >90. [193,274] . BII provides a
measure of the intactness of the local communities within a region relative to their
original state. However, intact ecosystems vary globally with more intact biomes in
boreal and tundra biomes (see Figure 7). [274] Of this 51%, approximately 15% of global
land area has legal protection status and can be classified as natural habitats which are
home to unique species, many that are severely threatened and require large intact
areas with little to no human intervention. The CBD’s Aichi Target 11 has set 17% as
the area-based global target for protected areas, with a focus on the legal protection of
Key Biodiversity Areas [275], and Hotspots. [276]
The remaining 36% of intact ecosystems do not have legal protection status but
maintain high biodiversity intactness values. [274] The boreal and tundra biomes are more
than 70% intact, contrasted with the Mediterranean biome, which is less than 17%
intact [274] . The most threatened biomes are those with the greatest agricultural value,
including grassland, dry tropical forest, and temperate forest biomes. In contrast,
biomes that have lower value for food production are well conserved and protected,
notably the higher latitude tundra and boreal biomes. The combination of intact biome
area, with a target of >50%, and biodiversity intactness, with a target of >90, provide a
powerful combination of metrics speaking to the degree to which progress must be
made to protect global biodiversity (Figure 7). Because biodiversity is local, and nontradable (e.g. orangutans are unique to Indonesian forests, gorillas to Central African
forests and prehensile tailed monkeys to neotropical forests), these targets must be set
at the ecoregion level thus ensuring an even distribution of conservation efforts globally
and avoiding targeting conservation efforts on low value regions while sacrificing high
conservation value areas.
Croplands and grazing lands (i.e. rangelands and pasturelands) occupy approximately
40% of ice-free terrestrial landmass. Jointly, these agricultural systems are the world’s
largest ecosystems and in addition to food production, they provide other important
services such as habitat for biodiversity and carbon sinks. Griscom et al. [277] showed that
between 2 to 8 Gt CO2 can be sequestered by using practices such as nutrient
41
management, trees in croplands, improved paddy rice production, and grazing animal
management. [277]
**Figure 7.** The relationship between two metrics for measuring biodiversity loss and land-system
change: (x-axis) area-based intactness and Half Earth strategy proposed by Wilson (2016) and
Dinerstein et al. (2017); and (y-axis) the species composition-based biodiversity intactness
index (BII) proposed by Steffen et al. (2015) and analyzed globally by Newbold et al.
(2016). Four biomes (green shaded area) have both a BII>90 and more than 50% by area intact
while four biomes (red shaded area) have neither. The remaining six biomes are below one, but
not both targets (yellow). The size of the circles reflects the area of the biome in question.
Grazing and pasture lands occupy approximately 23% of total ice-free land surface and
are important for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. They may also be
particularly important in restoration strategies in formerly grassland biomes or
reforestation in formerly forest biomes, which will be necessary for removing massive
amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere to stay well below 2°C. Reforestation, however, is
constrained by land availability and therefore reforestation of degraded pastures and
rangelands in original forest biomes offers an opportunity to remove CO2 from the
atmosphere while providing additional biodiversity conservation benefits. [277] Conversion
of the remaining rangelands and pasturelands should be treated with caution given the
potentially high opportunity cost resulting from biodiversity loss and CO2 emissions.
##### Scientific target for land-system change from food production - Global cropland use kept at or below current levels of 13 M km [2]
We use minimum forest cover, BII, and area based intactness for key biomes as guides
for setting the scientific target for land use from food production. [190] Given that
agriculture is the largest driver of deforestation and land-use globally, the only way to
achieve the Paris Agreement and reduce biodiversity loss is to halt agricultural
expansion into forest areas and other natural ecosystems. This means keeping global
land use from food production at or below current levels of 13 M km [2 ] (11-15 M km [2] ).
The scientific target for food production set here defined in the context of the major
global pressures posed by producing food at a time when humanity has already
transformed more than 40% of all terrestrial ecosystems for food production. Recent
42
proposals suggest that we can halt biodiversity loss and conserve at least 80% of
preindustrial species richness by protecting the remaining 50% of Earth as intact
ecosystems. [274,278] This suggests that the quantitative boundary estimates for landsystem change and biodiversity loss proposed by this Commission can be translated to
(globally) _zero_ future land conversion of natural ecosystems into farmland, i.e., to adopt
a "Half Earth" strategy. This strategy is in line with the biome or regional boundary
proposed by Steffen et al. (2015) of maintaining a biodiversity intactness index (BII) of
90% (see Figure 7). Adopting a Half Earth strategy, if implemented by biome, would
have multiple co-benefits such as maintaining functional diversity in ecosystems,
reducing GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), and
stimulating afforestation or reforestation efforts which are important for helping to meet
the Paris Agreement (see Panel 6). The Half Earth strategy recognizes that humanity
has now reached the end of its >8,000-year era of expanding agricultural area on
Earth. [190,278] Half Earth can be achieved either through legal protection or through
biodiversity compatible land uses such as sustainable harvest of native forests,
indigenous areas, or low intensity grazing systems in grassland ecosystems or other
land uses that maintain BII>90.
Staying within the biodiversity boundary for food production also depends on fine scale
conservation efforts within agricultural landscapes. Most of biodiversity loss is driven by
habitat fragmentation and agricultural intensification including the loss of fallows, buffer
systems, and embedded conservation structures in agriculture. Integrating at minimum
10% ecologically conserved land at very fine scales (<1 km [2] ) into agricultural systems
allows for habitat connectivity, which is essential for species survival, and access to the
services biodiversity provides to support food production. In addition, climate change
driven alteration of ecosystems is second to land use change in terms of threats to
biodiversity loss. Ensuring that species ranges can shift on pace with climate change
requires conservation action both on habitat and connectivity. [279,280]
Maintaining at least 10% ecological conservation within agricultural landscapes yields
additional benefits. This includes pollination services, of which more than 75% of staple
crops are dependent and contribute to 35% of global crop production by volume for
fruits, nuts, vegetables and other species essential to healthy diets. Meta-analyses of
pollination and pest control services in agriculture document that species providing
these services rarely move more than 100’s of meters from conservation
infrastructure. [281] Natural vegetation along streams (riparian buffers) and conserved
field margins can intercept up to 90% of excess nutrient run-off during normal flow
events, [282] which is another co-benefit of this conservation strategy. Lastly, conservation
within croplands and rangelands has the potential of increasing carbon sequestration
potential.
###### **Scientific targets and strategic directions for sustainable food production**
Table 3 provides scientific targets for the planetary boundaries for food production
presented in this Commission. These global scientific targets provide an integrated
definition of sustainable food production in the Anthropocene, which furthermore can be
translated to science-based targets for different scales (regions, nations) and sectors.
Furthermore, the scientific targets for sustainable food production presented here (Table
3), can be translated to strategic directions including:
43
 - Feed humanity essentially on current agricultural land, which means a transition
to _zero_ expansion of new agricultural land at the expense of natural ecosystems.
 - Urgent and radical move towards halting loss of biodiversity, which essentially
translates to _zero_ loss of biodiversity.
 - Decarbonise the entire food value chain from production to consumption, i.e.,
_zero_ fossil-fuels by 2050, and maintain GHG emissions at or below 5 Gt CO2-eq
yr [-1] for the biologically driven greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) associated with
food production.
 - Radical improvement in systems scale (rural-urban) nutrient use efficiency and
recycling of N and P.
 - Reduce food loss and waste by 50% to decrease pressure on food demand.
 - Transform to sustainable intensification of food production, adopting sustainable
practices for soil, water, nutrients and chemicals, corresponding to nothing less
than a new agricultural revolution.
 - Integrate 10% ecological conservation into current agricultural landscapes and
regenerate and reforest degraded land.
 - Adopt a "Half Earth" strategy for biodiversity conservation by protecting 50% of
Earth as intact ecosystems.

##### **An Earth system approach to assessing sustainable food production**
A reliance on using only one or a few indicators of environmental sustainability, as is
common in many studies, is a limitation from an Earth system perspective because the
metrics used influence the conclusions that can be drawn. For example, if only GHG
emissions is assessed then it might be inferred that a single intervention such as a
44
dietary shift would be sufficient for ensuring environmental sustainability when in fact
other key biophysical processes such as water use, land-use, nitrogen and
phosphorous cycling and biodiversity loss might still exceed food production
boundaries.
Using an Earth system approach to define sustainable food production necessitates that
we broaden our view of environmental sustainability to include all of the biophysical
processes described in this report. This wider perspective allows us to better assess
which combination of interventions are necessary for staying within all of the planetary
boundaries for food production while still delivering healthy diets to a global population.
Achieving this “win-win” dietary pattern, which is both healthy and environmentally
sustainable, is a prerequisite for meeting the SDGs and Paris Agreement.
Looking forward toward the SDG timeline to 2030 and Paris Agreement timeline to
2050, means reconciling the fact that the global population will increase to nearly 10
billion people. Meeting the demands of a global population by 2050 necessitates that we
find solutions to the dilemma of increasing food production while decreasing
environmental impact. Given this, we not only need to understand the link between diets
and environmental sustainability, we also need to understand the linkages between
other interventions such as food production practices and food waste and their impact
on environmental degradation. This is important because the environmental impacts of
certain foods are highly dependent upon production practices.
#### **Chapter 4 - Achieving healthy diets from sustainable food** **systems**
##### **Environmental impacts of individual foods and dietary patterns**
A large body of literature has examined the impacts of foods and dietary patterns on the
environment, with most assessing the impact of GHG emissions. For example, a recent
systematic review by Clune et al. [283] presents the GHG emissions of different food
categories from LCA studies and shows a clear hierarchy of emissions whereby grains,
fruits and vegetables have the lowest impact and meat from ruminants the highest
impact. A few others have looked at water use. [284] Overall, studies concur that plantbased foods have a lower environmental impact per unit weight, per serving, per unit of
energy, or per protein weight than animal source foods across a range of environmental
indicators (Figure 8).
Environmental impacts of foods can be measured using various units including per kcal,
per g protein, or per serving, depending on the nutritional contribution of each food. [4]
Using a universal indicator to measure environmental impact can be misleading for
certain foods. For example, vegetables contain very few calories per serving and using
kcal to measure their environmental impact would indicate that some vegetables would
have relatively high environmental footprints when in fact from a per serving basis their
environmental impacts are low. Given this, environmental impacts are shown per
serving in Figure 8.

standard deviation. Plant-based foods are colored in green; fish in blue; dairy and eggs in grey;
and meats in red. Data sources are Tilman and Clark (2017) and Clune et al (2017). [41]
##### **Environmental impacts of the food system**
Devising a sustainable food system that can deliver healthy diets for a growing
population presents us with formidable challenges. A large body of work has emerged
on the environmental impacts of various diets, with most studies finding decreasing
impacts with increased replacement of animal source with plant-based foods. [4,5,285-287]
Vegan and vegetarian diets were associated with the greatest reductions in GHG
emissions and land use [4,288] and vegetarian diets with the greatest reductions in water
use. [286] Diets that replaced ruminants with other alternatives, such as fish, poultry and
pork, also show reduced environmental impacts, but less so than plant-based
alternatives. [287] Overall, this literature indicates a diet that includes more plant-based
foods, and fewer animal source foods would confer significant health and environmental
benefits. Agricultural studies, on the other hand, have investigated potential changes in
technologies and management that could decrease environmental impacts, e.g. by
increasing yields on existing croplands and improving water and fertilizer
management. [244,289,290]
Here we analyse what combinations of measures are needed to stay within all of the
food production boundaries (Table 3) while still delivering healthy diets (Table 1). For
that purpose, we use a global food systems model with country-level detail that converts
consumption patterns, such as the healthy reference diet described in Chapter 2, into
the associated food production needs. The model takes into account current and future
projections of food demand, trade, livestock feed requirements, processing of oilseeds
and sugar crops, and non-food demands for agricultural products by industry. A full
description of the model is provided in the methods appendix and by Springmann and
colleagues. [291] Here we extend the analysis by considering a broader set of dietary
scenarios and sensitivity analyses.
46
For assessing the environmental impacts of food consumption we paired the model’s
future food projections with country-level environmental footprints which we obtained
from various sources (See Supplementary Table 5). [292-295] In line with current literature [41],
our results indicate that animal source foods have relatively high footprints per serving
for GHG emissions, cropland use, water use and N and P application. The total
environmental impacts are determined by combining region-specific footprints with
estimates of food demand.
Future food demand is influenced by changes in population and income. The former
changes the absolute quantity of food produced, and the latter the types of foods that
are produced. With increasing income, diets are expected to shift towards high-value
foods, such as meat and dairy, as well as fruits and vegetables. [296] Our baseline
(business-as-usual, BAU) projections follows a middle-of-the-road socio-economic
development pathway (SSP2 – see Supplementary Table 1), in which the global
population is projected to grow by a third and income is projected to triple. [292]
For the BAU scenario, we project the potential impacts of food production on GHG
emissions, cropland use, freshwater use, and N and P application, forecasting that
these could increase by 50-90% from 2010 to 2050 in absence of dedicated mitigation
measures. [291] This would push key biophysical processes that regulate the state of the
Earth system well beyond the boundaries and safe operating space for food production
(Figure 9). Different food groups contribute to different degrees to the environmental
impacts. Animal-source foods are responsible for about three quarters of the climate
change impacts, whereas staple crops, such as wheat, rice and other cereals, are
responsible for a third to half of the pressures on the other environmental domains.
**Figure 9.** Current and future environmental impact by food groups on various Earth systems
and assuming trends in consumption and production follow a business-as-usual trajectory.
47
##### **Scenarios for achieving healthy diets from sustainable food systems**
Several measures exist to reduce the environmental impacts of food production. For the
purpose of our analysis, we grouped them under three categories: dietary changes
towards healthier diets; technological and management-related changes in food
production; and reductions in food loss and waste that involves both technical changes
(related to food loss during production) and behavioural changes (related to food waste
at the point of consumption). The measures we considered (Table 4) have been put
forward in the research literature and some have been declared as global or national
goals (e.g., reductions in food loss and waste). In general, we focused on those
measures that are feasible with current technologies but have not been widely adopted.
**Table 4.** Measures considered for reducing environmental impacts from food production.
**Measures** **Assumptions**

implementation of agricultural mitigation options that are economic
at the projected social cost of carbon in 2050, [297] including changes

nitrous oxide emissions for rice and other crops, as well as changes
in manure management, feed conversion and feed additives that
reduce enteric fermentation in livestock. [298]

Our analysis shows that to stay within the safe operating space for food systems
requires a combination of production and dietary and management-related measures
(Table 5). While some individual measures are enough to stay within specific
boundaries, no single intervention is enough to stay below all boundaries
simultaneously. In reference to Table 5, we discuss each boundary in turn.

measures outlined above. The colours illustrate whether environmental impacts transgress food
production boundaries: green - below lower range value; light green - below or equal to
boundary but above lower range value; orange - above boundary but below upper range value;

**Climate change**
Several studies have analysed measures to reduce the GHG emissions related to food
production. While technological and management-related options have an important
role to play, [290,298,301] many studies highlight dietary change towards more plant-based
diets as a measure with high mitigation potential that is likely needed to limit global
warming to below 2°C. [4,5,302-304] The technological and management-related changes for
reducing GHG emissions include changes in irrigation, cropping and fertilization that
reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice and other crops, as well as
changes in manure management, feed conversion and feed additives that reduce
enteric fermentation in livestock. [298] We estimated that existing mitigation technologies
49
and changes in management could reduce agricultural GHG emissions in 2050 by
about 10%, whereas dietary changes towards more plant-based diets could deliver
emissions reductions of up to 80%. [291] A further 5% reduction could be achieved by
halving food loss and waste.
Staying within the boundary for climate change can be achieved by dietary changes
towards more plant-based diets. Technical and management-related changes are less
effective in abating food-related GHG emissions because the majority of emissions are
associated with the production of animal source foods whose characteristics, such as
enteric fermentation in ruminants, have limited potential for change. Ambitious dietary
changes towards more plant-based diets are therefore a necessary component for
staying within the climate change boundary for food production.
**#### Insert Panel 8 – The future of food in the face of climate change ####**
**Land-system change**
Future land-use changes depend greatly on agricultural yields (i.e., the output of food
production per area) and the composition of crops that are demanded and
produced, [244,289,296,305] which in turn are influenced by dietary choices and changes in
technologies and crop management. It has been estimated that current yield trends are
insufficient to meet global demand for wheat, maize, rice, and soybean if trends
continue towards diets that are high in animal source foods. [306] Currently, almost two
thirds of all soybeans, maize, barley, and about a third of all grains are used as feed for
animals, so reductions in the portion of animal products in our diets would make the
cropland associated with feed production available for other uses. [305] However, whether
changing dietary preferences would result in a net decrease in the use of cropland
depends also on the yields of the replacing crops, and those differences in yield might
not be as favourable as one might expect, considering that investments in high-yielding
varieties have been primarily directed towards major grains over the last half
century. [307,308] Our dietary scenarios include large amounts of nutritionally important but
relatively low-yielding crops, such as legumes and nuts. [305]
Our results indeed portray a complex picture. [291] The impacts of dietary changes
(without targeted reductions in energy intake) resulted in small reductions in cropland
use of 0-2%. The reason that we did not observe greater reductions from dietary
change alone was that the reductions in cropland demand by countries with high
portions of animal source foods were compensated by increases in cropland demand by
countries that consume poor quality diets high in grains. By food group, the reductions
in cropland use for feed crops was, to a large extent, compensated by large increases in
cropland use for legumes and nuts which are relatively low-yielding. Redirecting
investments towards higher-yielding varieties of those crops could be an effective
strategy for reducing cropland use in the context of changes towards healthier diets
which contain larger amounts of legumes and nuts. Our estimates of projected yield
trends, and of changes in food loss and waste are more straight-forward. Based on data
on yield trends and potential yield improvements across regions, we estimated that no
cropland expansion will be needed if current yield gaps (i.e., the difference between
current and attainable yields) were closed to about 75% percent. [244] And halving food
loss and waste by 2050 could reduce cropland use by about 14%.
50
Staying within the boundary for cropland use can be achieved in combinations that
include increases in crop yields and reductions in food loss and waste. Some dietary
scenarios, e.g. the healthy reference diet with modest amounts of meat and dairy, would
require ambitious improvements in yields to become feasible.
**#### Insert Panel 9 – Livestock on leftovers ####**
**Freshwater use**
Previous studies have highlighted the potential of increasing water-use efficiency by
improving water management and technologies, such as irrigation systems, [309,310] as
well as by dietary change towards diets lower in animal products. [311] Using data from
basin-scale hydrological models, [292] we estimated that technological and managementrelated changes could reduce water use by about 30%, and halving food loss and waste
could reduce water use by about 13%. [291] For dietary changes, we identified similar
trade-offs as for cropland use. Without reductions in energy intake, water use could
increase by 1-9% as reductions related to lower consumption of animal products and
sugar are overcompensated by increases related to greater consumption of nuts and
legumes. The lower end of the reductions is for the more plant-based scenarios that
include larger amounts of water-intensive nuts and legumes.
According to our estimates, staying within the planetary boundary for water use can be
achieved by combining improvements in water-use efficiency with reductions in food
loss and waste. However, our analysis does not highlight regions or nations that
currently face water shortage and are already above regional or national boundaries for
EFRs. This is discussed in more detail in chapter 3 and panel 11.
**Nitrogen and phosphorus application**
The reduction of impacts related to the over-application of N and P fertilizers is receiving
increasing interest. The discussed measures include technology-driven increases in use
efficiencies, [312,313] improvements in the management of livestock and manure, [314-316]
improvements in fertilizer application and distribution, [244,313,316] reductions in household
waste, [315] nutrient recycling e.g. through improvements in sewage systems, [299] and
dietary changes towards diets with fewer animal products. [315] In our analysis, we
represented the various mitigation strategies by increases in use efficiencies,
improvements in fertilizer application and distribution, and dietary changes. [291]
We estimated that increased use efficiencies and optimised application of fertilizers,
including rebalancing between over and under-applying regions could reduce N and P
use by about 26% for N and up to 48% for P. Reductions in food loss and waste could
deliver up to 15% reduction in each nutrient, and dietary change towards healthy diets
could reduce total application needs by about 10%. Staying below the upper ranges for
N and P application required a combination of technological and management-related
changes, dietary changes, and reductions in food loss and waste.
**Biodiversity**
Previous studies have demonstrated the impact of increasing agricultural expansion on
biodiversity loss, especially in tropical counties where biodiversity rates are
highest. [18,254,262] Biodiversity loss is most severe when natural habitat (e.g. primary
tropical forest) is converted to agriculture, especially when compared to conversion of
secondary or degraded habitats. Our results support this in that biodiversity loss was
51
orders of magnitude higher when compared to conversion of secondary of managed
habitats (Table 5).
We found that cropland use and extinction rates were synergistic with the greatest
reductions occurring with technological and management-related changes and
reductions in food loss and waste. The projected extinctions in our analysis show high
spatial variation, with a high number of extinctions projected to occur in tropical
countries and island countries with high numbers of endemic species richness.
Projected extinction rates far exceed recent extinction rates [260,317] if cropland expansion
occurs at the cost of existing primary habitat.
Extinction risk can be reduced through a variety of measures. First, expanding cropland
into existing secondary habitat (e.g. logged forests, plantations) or other managed
ecosystems (e.g. pastures and rangelands) reduces the number of species lost by
>90%. Second, adopting technologies and management related changes has the
greatest potential of reducing global biodiversity loss (~75% relative to the BAU)
because of the reductions in cropland expansion. Third, halving food loss and waste
can reduce the projected biodiversity loss by as much as 33% relative to the BAU
scenario and has a relatively smaller potential to benefit biodiversity.
We found that adopting the reference healthy diet (or one of its variations) could
increase the global number of extinctions if land-use change occurs in areas of current
production. This is mainly a result of 1) increased caloric intake to the recommended
2500 kcal capita [-1 ] day [-1 ] in the reference diet in countries where the consumption levels
are below this and 2) shifting production priorities to produce crops (e.g. nuts and
pulses) needed to support the reference diet. These results assume, however, that a
proportion of the additional demand will be met by domestic production. A rebalancing
of regional production based on biodiversity concerns could mitigate those additional
stresses (OPT scenarios in Table 5). Our models support other research and
demonstrate that rebalancing or optimizing global land use based on biodiversity
concerns could have the single greatest impact on reducing biodiversity loss. [305,318]
Results from all of our optimization scenarios and their impact on each boundary can be
found in Supplementary Table 6.
The biodiversity boundary can only be met when adopted measures are in line with our
strategic directions for high-order transformations of the global food system (see
chapter 3). Other measures that should be adopted include; establishment of new
protected areas; [319] expansion and increased enforcement of protected areas in key
biodiversity areas; [319-321] increasing international trade from higher yielding and less
diverse nations to lower yielding and more diverse nations, [18,322-324] and minimizing
agricultural expansion into species rich areas.
##### **Sensitivity analysis**
We undertook a series of sensitivity analyses to identify additional dietary aspects of
importance for staying within the boundaries for food production. For that purpose, we
varied the composition of the reference diet by changing its meat and dairy content, and
we assessed the importance of scale effects by considering a scenario of lower caloric
intake (Table 6). Increasing the limit on red meat intake from one 100 g serving per
week to three (the current recommendation put forward by the World Cancer Research
Fund for lowering the cancer-related risks of red meat consumption [325] ) led to a near
52
doubling of food-related GHG emissions and total environmental impacts comparable to
those of the business-as-usual pathway. Increasing milk consumption from 250 g/d in
the reference diet to 500 g/d (a level still below current US dietary guidelines) led to a
more than 40% increase in GHG emissions and total environmental impacts that
exceeded those of the BAU scenario for cropland use, freshwater use, and nitrogen
application. Neither scenario could be combined with technical and managementrelated changes to become a feasible combination that would stay below the
boundaries for food production. In contrast, reducing caloric intake from 2500 kcal/d to
2100 kcal/d, a value assuming that body mass index is reduced to 22 kg/m [2] globally,
which is in line with WHO recommendations on healthy body weight and physical
activity levels, [326] reduced environmental impacts by up to 14% and resulted in total
environmental impacts that were significantly lower than those of the BAU projections.
**Table 6.** Environmental impacts of increased meat (ref high meat) and milk (ref high milk)
consumption above those recommended by the reference diet and reduced caloric intake to
2100 kcal/day (ref low cal). The colours illustrate whether environmental impacts transgress the
food production boundaries: green - below lower range value; light green - below or equal to
boundary but above lower range value; orange - above boundary but below upper range value;

##### **Implications for future food production**
Aligning future diets with the reference diet (Table 1) will require significant changes in
what foods are produced globally (Figure 10). For example, a shift to the reference diet
and halving food loss and waste would need an increase in global legume production by
more than 210% and in the production of nuts and seeds by 170%. In comparison, the
expected growth of these crops along a BAU pathway would imply an increase of
legumes and nuts of only 83% and 46%, respectively. A shift to the reference diet and
halving food loss and waste would imply substantial reductions for beef (65%) and pork
(85%), compared to large expected projected increases in production along a BAU
pathway. Seafood production, on the other hand, is predicted to increase by 48% in a
BAU pathway but nearly 120% if the reference diet is adopted globally. This highlights
the potential importance of seafood as a protein source in the future and the need for
developing sustainable production practices (Panel 10).

the BAU and the healthy reference diet, full and half waste scenarios, respectively.
**#### Insert Panel 10 – The role of seafood in global diets ####**
##### **Uncertainty in the modelling results**
Throughout the report we have addressed uncertainties that exist in our estimates of the
scientific targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production. In line with previous
uncertainties, we have a much higher level of certainty in the overall direction and
approximate magnitude of the relationships presented in Table 5 than about specific
quantitative details. For example, we can be fairly certain about the trend of decreasing
rates of biodiversity loss with dietary changes and improved production practices.
However, we are less certain about the exact number of species that will be lost for
each scenario and each dietary change. This is also the case for the other control
variables in that we are less certain in the specific numbers resulting from each scenario
but have much higher certainty in the trends of decreasing environmental impact with
improvements in production practices, reduction in food loss and waste, and shifts
toward healthy diets.
The role of innovative technologies [327] that are not yet proven at scale but might become
operational at some point in the future were not specifically investigated by this
Commission given the limited data available on the environmental impacts of those
technologies. Some examples of potential game changers include using insects, algae
and microbes as animal feed, [23,328] laboratory-cultured meat [329] . In our report, we chose
to focus on solutions that are readily available today but might not have been deployed
at scale.
#### **Chapter 5 – A framework for a Great Food Transformation**
##### **Lessons from past successful global transformations**
The EAT-Lancet Commission does not underestimate the gravity of its message or the
urgency of the task. They are in line with international reviews of different aspects of
global food systems over the last decade. [3,330-340] The Commission envisages what is
needed as nothing less than a Great Food Transformation. By transformation, we mean
54
a substantial change in the structure and function of the global food system so that it
operates with different core processes and feedbacks. [341] This transformation will not
happen unless there is widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action to change what is
eaten, how it is produced and its impacts, while ensuring healthy diets for all.
There is no magic ‘fix’ to the problems the Commission has explored. They require hard
work, political will and resources. There are unlikely to be any simple or ‘one shot’
technical fixes, and opponents will warn of unintended consequences or argue the case
for action is premature or left to existing dynamics. The Commission disagrees. _**The**_
_**data are both sufficient and strong enough to warrant action**_ **.** Delay will increase
the likelihood of serious, even disastrous, consequences. We are clear, too, that the
approaches taken in the Great Food Transformation should be guided by the scientific
targets that define the safe operating space for food systems: the mix of healthy diets
and planetary systems and processes which underpin human health and environmental
sustainability. Simply to focus on one at the expense of others would be self-defeating.
Humanity has never before set out to change the food system so radically at this scale
or speed. There have been major national food system transformations in the 20 [th]
century by countries such as China, Brazil, Vietnam and Finland [342-344] from which to
draw lessons. The world’s diet has also been shown to be able to change relatively
rapidly. Within a few decades countries have changed diets, going through a nutrition
transition, some of whose dynamics such as sweetening are now clear. [345]
Wars and disasters also provide ominous lessons, both of destructive effects and of
seizing opportunities from the ashes of grim experience. Arguably, only at the end of
World War 2 was there the kind of global effort and commitment to redirect the food
system that this Commission believes now is necessary. [346,347] New institutions were
created or revised at the global level such as the WHO, FAO and World Bank which
allied with new and renewed national Ministries of agriculture and health to banish the
pre-War food problems caused by market distortions, environmentally damaging
farming, and social inequalities. [346,347] However, the negative consequences of the postwar food revolution are now becoming increasingly clear. The data addressed in this
and other reports poses a more complex array of problems, which now require a new
vision. A second food revolution – a Great Food Transformation – is needed.
The Commission proposes that, while wars and disasters do shape subsequent history,
our evidence offers the chance to anticipate events and to shape better outcomes.
Encouragement can be drawn from previous, daring thinking and action in history. Table
7 lists some examples where science has informed and / or led global transformations.
None are as extensive as the Great Food Transformation must be, but optimism and
some lessons can be derived.
The first lesson from past global transformation is that no single actor or breakthrough is
likely to catalyze systems change. Systems change is by definition extensive and will
therefore require actors at all scales and in all sectors engaged and working toward a
shared set of goals. This lesson lies at the heart of Sustainable Development Goal 17
which recognizes that a “ _A successful sustainable development agenda requires_
_partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. These inclusive_
_partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared goals that_
_place people and the planet at the centre, are needed at the global, regional, national_
_and local level_ .”

56
Secondly, science and evidence-gathering are keys to change. Attention must
constantly be given to what is at present a yawning gap between the evidence of food
system problems and policy leverage to effect change. Yet the Commission’s modelling
suggests that it is possible to meet the goal of healthy diets for all from sustainable food
systems. 10 billion people could be fed a healthy and sustainable diet. The gap between
the present unequal, unsustainable food system and a better one can be narrowed.
Interdisciplinary research and monitoring will be central in this process, not least to
maintain the scale and pace of change. While long-term research is important, research
is needed _**now**_ to help policy actors operate on a sound basis at a pace in line with the
urgency of what is known already.
The third lesson is that the full range of policy levers is likely to be needed. Faced with
challenges, policy-makers’ reflexes can be first to draw from the ‘soft’ end of possible
policy interventions, such as consumer advice, information, education or, in the case of
food, labelling. These kinds of interventions assume that consumer actions will generate
sufficient change. [365,366] They are generally slow in impact – unless there is already
mass public interest in change. However, the scale of change which must begin is
unlikely to be successful if left to the individual or the whim of consumer choice. It
requires reframing at the population and systemic level.
At the ‘hard’ end of policy intervention lies laws, fiscal measures, subsidies and
penalties, trade reconfiguration, and other economic and structural measures. These
alter the conditions under which the whole population exists. While the former are slow
and incremental, the latter can be brusque and meet resistance. The Commission
accepts that what kind of interventions are adopted is the prerogative of governments,
the people and processes. Countries and authorities should not, however, _a priori_
restrict themselves only to narrow measures or soft interventions. Such is the extent of
change required that it is surely likely to need to draw on the full range, not just one or
two policy levers. [367] Table 8 uses the Nuffield Ladder of Policy Interventions to indicate
what different policy actors might do to improve dietary health from sustainable food
systems. Too often policy remains on the bottom ‘soft’ rungs 1-3 of the policy ladder.
The policy terrain indicated by this Commission is very broad. Faced with immense
challenges, some argue that it is best to refine attention to just a few ‘winnable’ targets.
We disagree. A shared, planetary overview requires a parallel extensive policy
umbrella. The vision we offer here, with scientific targets for healthy diets and
sustainable food production inevitably takes food, health and environmental policy into
many policy areas, ranging across trade, economics, rural livelihoods, equity, culture,
social and community policies. [368] This is a strength not a diffusion of effort. For the food
system to change, and for healthy diets to be available to all requires not just food
production or consumption to change but sectors in the middle of the food chain such as
food processing, storage, logistics, retail and food service. They need to be engaged in
the transformation, not least because economic power and cultural influence within
current food systems often resides with these intermediary sectors. [369-371] The
Commission therefore calls for more work on these stages of global food systems.

#### **Five strategies for a Great Food Transformation**
In addition to the general lessons that we can learn from past global transformations, we
outline five readily implementable strategies and recommendations for how these could
be achieved. For each strategy, there is a strong enough evidence foundation, and our
modelling and analysis demonstrates their effectiveness for achieving a sustainable
food system transformation. The strategies offered here are proposals to begin
processes. As such, this chapter does not provide an exhaustive nor prescriptive list of
actions. Rather, these are presented as indicative entry points for further contextspecific national, regional, city and local change. This chapter also makes no distinction
between short- and long-term strategies, mindful that countries at different levels of
economic development have great variations in political opportunities, resources, local
circumstance and starting points.
##### **Strategy one - winning international and national commitment to shift** **toward healthy diets**
Consumption is affected by many social, economic, geographic and political factors not
addressed in this report. Shifting diets will require engaging with culture, taste, traditions
and other social dimensions of food. There is the need to ensure affordability and
accessibility of food, particularly in low-income countries, to change dietary norms, and
to enhance knowledge of healthy diets from sustainable food systems in order to stay
within the safe operating space for food systems. These diets should be at the least
enjoyable and universally appealing in terms of taste, price and acceptability if
necessary shifts are to occur. Physicians, public health bodies, food service leaders,
civil society, and businesses need a coherent and united approach to shift the many
drivers of dietary choices so that healthy diets from sustainable food systems become
the aspirational eating patterns.
_**Increase availability and physical access to healthy diets from sustainable food**_
_**systems**_
Retailers and food service shape the immediate environment in which people buy food.
In high income societies, a priority is almost certainly to offer less – smaller portions,
possibly less choice (who can discriminate wisely when faced by 20-30,000 food items
in a hypermarket), and less packaging, as well as new, innovative packaging to
preserve perishable foods. [372] Low income countries have different priorities – cutting
waste on or near primary production, better logistics and storage – to increase the
range and a-seasonality of foods. In both high and low income societies, public and
private sector procurement standards should be guided by the need to improve diets,
and appropriate access to outlets or vendors providing healthy products. Local
authorities need powers to apply zoning regulations in low-income areas to restrict
unhealthy food outlets. [373] Contracts and procurement policies can be used to promote
healthy diets from sustainable food systems in workplaces, schools and venues where
public meals are provided, but these policies need persistence and continued political
leadership for success. Multiple indicators of both human and environmental health
discussed in this report need to be applied. [374] Public distribution programs targeting
low-income households and individuals can improve nutritional status. [375] While to date,
there is little evidence that improved infrastructure or zoning regulations lead to healthy
food consumption or reductions in BMI, this may be due to poor policy or evaluation
design and limited data, and further research is warranted. [376] Urban planning
59
interventions should account for local context and address the complex ways in which
residents of low-income areas interact with their local food systems, such as their
ability/desire to travel to different areas to buy food. [377]
In low-income countries, ensuring adequate infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges and
transportation) to remote or rural areas can also increase access as well as reduce food
prices, food price volatility in local markets, [378] and food losses during transport.
Agricultural extension programs that focus on both nutrition and food security can also
help ensure that rural farmers and women in rural households are equipped with the
information and skills they need to better obtain healthy diets from sustainable food
systems. [379,380] In areas with informal markets, price incentives for street vendors to use
healthier and more sustainable ingredients and investment in sanitary locations for
these outlets have been recommended to increase availability of safe, nutritious food. [340]
_**Increase affordability of healthy diets from sustainable food systems**_
Price is a core driver of the existing food system. Primary producers are locked into
demands from off the land to produce commodities cheaply but plentifully. Consumers
value food being sufficiently low cost to enable them to make other domestic purchases.
While low income societies spend relatively high percentages of household budgets on
food, it is the reverse in high income societies. Food prices are relative to social
circumstance within and between societies. That consumer food prices have become
relatively more affordable has been a success of the post World War 2 food revolution.
Today, some foods are under pressure to rise in price, so as to include externalities
currently not included. Experimentation with sugar or soft drink taxes is one example.
The Commission agrees that food prices should fully reflect costs. As a first step
subsidies on fertilizers, water, fuels, electricity, and pesticides should be critically
reviewed, with some authorities arguing for their removal. Secondly, the environmental
costs and societal health costs of food supply and consumption should be fully reflected
in pricing by introducing taxes to reframe market signals to reflect hidden health and
environmental costs. As a result, food prices may go up, so where appropriate, social
protection or safety nets can be established to protect vulnerable populations,
particularly children and women. At the same time, global realities mean trade must
remain open. Trade plays a positive role in improving food security, nutrition through
diversification of food baskets, producers, and suppliers. Trade also means that
production occurs where its use of natural resource and environmental impacts can be
low.
We recommend an expert panel be set up to model different economic interventions,
noting the work already underway from UNEP’s The Economics of Ecosystems &
Biodiversity for Agriculture and Food. [381] Taxes and subsidies should encourage
healthier, [382] and more sustainable diets. [383] These measures in combination limit the
potentially regressive nature of either measure implemented in isolation. [384] There is
significant potential for social protection ‘safety nets’ (e.g. increasing income through
cash transfers) to improve nutrition outcomes in low-income households, but these
programs must be explicitly ‘nutrition-sensitive’ for this potential to be fully realized. [385]
In rural areas, increasing food security can improve access to and affordability of
healthy diets from sustainable food systems. Access to economic resources and
poverty alleviation measures, particularly among women, are central to securing healthy
60
diets from sustainable food systems. Market access and off-farm opportunities are
essential to providing these rural farmers with the income needed to remain food
secure. [386] Reducing food price volatility is particularly important to ensure affordability of
healthy diets from sustainable food systems, particularly at the regional or local level.
Key policies to reduce food price volatility include removing market barriers across local
regions or markets; ensuring access to price information and early warning systems;
implementing tighter regulations against over-speculations; international management
of food stocks; revisions of biofuel subsidies and tariffs to avoid the diversion of food to
energy use; and establishing social protection schemes, insurance programs and other
safety nets. [387,388]
_**Improve information and food marketing**_
Renewed efforts by governments, industry and society are required to restrict
advertising and marketing of unhealthy, unsustainable foods, and to support positive
discrimination for healthy diets from sustainable food systems. This is in line with
numerous calls from the 2013 WHO Global Action Plan, 2011 UN conference, 2010
WHO recommendations for marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children
and the WHO Ending Childhood Obesity Commission. [389-392] The INFORMAS framework
is a tool that civil society and researchers can use to monitor food labelling, promotion
and retail (among other) activities in a particular food environment and then compare
those activities to best-practice for creating healthy food environments. [393]
_**Deliver education that promotes healthy diets from sustainable food systems**_
Experience indicates that education campaigns are less effective than regulatory or
fiscal measures in creating sustained change, particularly when implemented without
these more robust complementary measures. [394] Yet due to the significant barriers to
implementing ‘hard’ regulatory measures, educational efforts may be a necessary
precursor to stronger intervention and needs also to go hand in hand with it. Education
on healthy diets from sustainable food systems could be integrated into schools
(particularly school feeding and school meal programs), all national services, social
protection programs such as cash transfer programs and peer groups (e.g. women
farmer groups, co-operatives). Civil society groups, the media and other thought leaders
have a leading role in increasing public knowledge of healthy diets from sustainable
food systems through informational campaigns and the emergence of social movements
to shift diets or reduce food waste.
_**Implement food-based dietary guidelines**_
Dietary guidelines that integrate health and environmental sustainability considerations
could be one tool for nutrition education. To date, the introduction of such guidelines
has been slow, with many countries lacking official dietary guidelines. [395] In those
countries with official advice, these guidelines are rarely followed through with enabling
or enforcing legislation or other policies. As such they remain as the softest kind of
consumer advice rather than at mandatory or enforceable levels of standards-setting. [396]
Relevant national bodies should adopt guidelines for healthy diets from sustainable food
systems, backed by enabling policies and incentives and reflected through public
procurement policies. Public sector organizations could work with non-governmental
organizations already progressing guidelines for healthy diets from sustainable food
systems. [397,398]
61
_**Promote diets which taste good, and are culturally appropriate**_
There is no need for sustainable diets to taste bad. Chefs and foodservice sectors
increasingly recognize they play an important role in the Great Food Transformation.
Whether designing new menus, [399-401] or taking a lead in the many national public
campaigns around health and sustainability - as did 130 chefs from 38 countries on
World Food Day October 10 2017, and Nordic chefs did with the New Nordic Kitchen
Manifesto in 2004 [402] - or pioneering peer-group education with other chefs via
professional bodies, [403] the cooking and catering enterprise is now a key public health
change agent. Good, tasty, affordable, enjoyable food can be a key ingredient in mass
dietary change. Consumers can and must like and help drive the dietary shift.
_**Use health care services to deliver dietary advice**_
Physicians and health care service workers have important roles in education and in
service delivery. These professionals can engage with others to redesign public food
provisions such as school and hospital meals and to advise food service industries. [399]
Health care workers also need to be equipped with the necessary information. Given
the importance of the development of food preferences during the first years of life and
even during gestation, [404,405] nutrition counseling (breastfeeding promotion and
appropriate complementary feeding) could be integrated into maternal and child care
programs. Medical education largely omits the importance of nutrition to health.
Curricula should be revised and new training packages created which combine nutrition
and ecosystems as determinants of health. Food services in health care facilities could
demonstrate a high standard for healthy foods and beverages from sustainable food
systems.
##### **Strategy two - reorienting agricultural priorities away from producing** **‘more’ food and towards producing ‘better’ food**
For healthy, sustainable diets to become the norm, it is crucial to produce food types
that are the constituents of a healthy, nutritious diet, and do so in a sustainable way.
Again, there are many mid-point activities which alter the healthiness of a food – the
entire value chain will need to be improved to ensure that nutrition gains momentum
across the chain instead of being lost or diminished due to processing and
packaging. [406]
_**Reframe production to emphasize diet quality and functional diversity**_
A fundamental reframing is needed to shift food policies from emphasizing greater
volumes of outputs to an emphasis on a greater diversity of crops and the nutritional
quality of foods produced. Researchers and public health professionals are raising the
profile of diet quality by calling for better data to track diet quality, [407] recommending that
improved diet quality assessments be developed, [408] and emphasizing the importance of
diet quality to food security. [409] The Commission recommends that resources be devoted
to the creation of a robust diet quality assessment tools, which could serve as a crosscutting SDG indicator, with requisite capacity building and regular data gathering efforts
at a country level. Emphasis could be placed on sustaining agricultural diversity to
ensure nutrition quality through support for small and medium farms, which supply over
50% of many essential nutrients in the global food supply. [410]
_**Ensure agricultural policies encourage production of nutritious foods**_
62
Agriculture is a main determinant of nutrition, and it has been recognized that national
and global agricultural policies should work to enhance nutrition outcomes. [411] Actions
can include providing incentives for primary producers to produce nutritious and plantfocused foods, focusing agricultural research investments on identifying pathways for
increasing nutrition and sustainability or developing programs to support diverse and
environmentally sustainable production systems. Because evaluations of the
effectiveness of agricultural policies on nutrition and health outcomes can be
challenging, greater resources need to be directed at developing high-quality
evaluations of the impact of upstream policies on nutritional outcomes. [412]
_**Support ‘less and better’ animal production**_
The growing demand for animal source foods puts pressure on land use, increases
GHG emissions, and if grain-fed, is also water intensive. **[4,5,18,303]** However, in some
contexts, animal production can also be core to supporting livelihoods, grassland
ecosystem services, poverty alleviation, and nutritional status benefits (particularly in
children and vulnerable populations). [413] As such, animal production needs to be
considered in a specific context to understand how much production should decrease in
a given environment, and what role sustainable practices (e.g. increasing feed use
efficiency [414] and reducing feed-food competition) that also support a broader range of
considerations such as animal welfare and antimicrobial resistance can play. There is
an emerging discourse exploring what ‘less and better’ means in different contexts. [415]
We support the continuation of this holistic evaluation of the context-specific trade-offs
or win-wins that could arise from animal production (see Panels 2 and 9).
##### **Strategy three - sustainably intensifying food production, generating** **more high-quality output**
A key element of sustainable intensification is closing existing yield gaps while capturing
environmental benefits of production systems. As measures that boost productivity
could incentivize producers to expand production onto new land, strict land use controls
(discussed below) must also be implemented. Solutions will vary by country depending
on factors such as natural resource endowment and climatic conditions.
_**Adapt cropping to bioclimatic conditions**_
Agricultural practices could be adapted to soil characteristics, water availability and
climatic drivers of evapotranspiration. **[416]** For example, in arid regions, drought tolerant
crop varieties could be selected, adequate cropping pattern could be used, and deficit
irrigation (only applied during the drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop) and
supplemental irrigation (applied to complement rainfall) could be applied. [417-421] Local to
global scale land use planning incorporating these considerations could improve
sustainability of food production, but complementary measures might also need to be
incorporated to ensure these regions have access to a diverse range of nutritious foods
(see Trade Panel 11). In addition, matching production practices to local conditions can
increase food production sustainably. [422]
**#### Insert Panel 11 – Free trade and food ####**
_**Practice precision agriculture**_
Precision agriculture techniques could be scaled up and subsidized. To obtain more
‘crop per drop’ of water, it is key to select the right crop cultivar planted at the right
63
density, time and rotation, to practice water capture (for a higher reliance on green
water), soil restoration, as well as drip irrigation combined with soil water harvesting and
soil conservation practices. [416] This will mean reducing nutrient applications in some
countries and increasing applications in others. Technologies needed for precision
agriculture currently are expensive, hence private sector companies have a role in
scaling them up for affordability and governments should provide subsidies to enable
their adoption in lower and middle-income countries.
_**Close nutrient loops**_
Practices to prevent nutrient losses from the farm include no/low tillage, using N-fixing
cover crops or crop varieties with greater root mass, rotational grazing, crop residue
management or field margin management such as riparian forests. **[423]** Further examples
include recycling and efficient use of manure and soil erosion control measures (e.g.
buffer strips to intercept both soils and nutrients). [424-429] Additional on-farm measures
include covered manure storage, anaerobic digestion for adjustment of nutrient ratios to
better match crop needs, and biogas production from manure (possibly to power onfarm machinery). [301,430,431] Larger-scale measures include recycling nitrogen and
phosphorus from wastewater systems, cities, agriculture and industry, and
implementing governance mechanisms to ensure regional compliance with water and
air quality targets related to reactive nitrogen and NOx formation.
_**Redistribute fertilizer use**_
Redistributing fertilizer from over- to under-applying regions would increase global food
production and improve nutrient use efficiency and water quality. [244] Increasing nutrient
inputs in regions with already high nutrient inputs tends to increase agricultural runoff
and reduce nutrient use efficiency and water quality. [432-434] In over-applying regions,
regulations could be used to mandate water quality targets. For example, after the EU
Nitrates Directive was put in place to limit nitrate concentrations in water, decreases in
fertilizer use in the EU have been associated with increases in water quality. [435] In
under-applying regions, subsidies that increase access to fertilizer can increase
yields. [436,437]
_**Turn agriculture into a carbon sink**_
Huge increases in carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and above-ground are
needed [37,438] and can be achieved through various measures. Such measures include
incorporating farm organic wastes into the soil, low/no tillage, nitrogen-fixing cover
plants, replacement of annuals with perennial crops and pastures, agroforestry,
establishing buffer strips and keeping some farmland under natural vegetation. These
measures may come at a cost to near-term yields and thus to the farm economy, calling
for significant policy support and financial incentives. The 10% conservation in
agriculture recommended in Chapter 3 can in many contexts serve multiple roles
including carbon capture, nutrient interception, and habitat and corridors for biodiversity
(e.g. riparian forests).
_**Include agroecological practices**_
Biodiversity conservation is essential to maintain ecosystem services that support
agriculture. In addition to land sparing measures proposed in the previous section,
practices that enhance biodiversity _within_ agricultural systems are needed, e.g. riparian
buffer strips or flower field margins. The presence of natural enemies from increased
biodiversity _within_ agricultural systems could prevent yield losses by contributing to
64
integrated weed, pest and disease management and could increase crop yields via
increased pollination by natural pollinators. [439,440] _Sparing_ remaining intact ecosystems is
essential to achieving the climate and biodiversity boundaries described in Chapter 3,
but it is also evident that _sharing_ space for biodiversity in production landscapes is
necessary to secure biodiversity’s contribution to food production including pollination,
pest control, carbon capture and regulating water quality.
##### **Strategy four - Stronger and coordinated governance of land and** **oceans**
To ensure that the food production boundaries are not surpassed, management of land
and oceans is vital. Land management needs to be based on an assessment of the
conservation, production/grazing, or restoration value of the specific region. On land
and in marine systems, stronger support for the protection of key biodiversity areas, and
intact ecosystems is urgently needed. Intact ecosystems that do not benefit from official
protection status need biodiversity conservation and climate compatible management
options that respect the rights of indigenous communities. Management of the world’s
oceans needs to ensure a future supply of wild fish and other seafood and at the same
time stimulate an expansion of marine aquaculture without compromising key
sustainability dimensions.
_**Halt expansion**_ **of new agricultural land at the expense of natural ecosystems.**
Direct regulatory measures include strict protections on intact ecosystems, suspending
concessions for logging in protected areas or conversion of remaining intact
ecosystems, particularly peatlands and forest areas. Other measures include land use
zoning, regulations prohibiting land clearing and incentives for protecting natural areas
including forests. Approaches that extend beyond the public sector, such as community
forest management, can also promote conservation, [441] but their effectiveness varies
greatly across contexts. [442,443] There has been recent enthusiasm for private sector
approaches (market-based instruments), but these do not substitute for regulatory
governance structures. [444] The boundary of zero net agricultural land expansion does
allow for some local expansion in defined contexts. Of particular importance is to
implement and enforce policy mechanisms that ensure that any agricultural expansion
occurs in existing managed forests (e.g. plantations), abandoned agricultural areas or
other managed ecosystems rather than expanding into natural habitats and other
species-rich areas. [305,318] Conversion within agricultural land also matters, and trade-offs
among multiple ecosystem services (e.g. potential biodiversity loss and/or potential
reduction in GHGs when shifting land uses) need to be considered. [445]
_**Establish international land use governance**_
Unprecedented levels of collective action at the local to global level are needed to stay
within the boundary of zero net land use. Coordinated, international governance across
national borders is needed to minimize ‘deforestation leakage’, or the phenomenon of
stronger land controls in one region encouraging agricultural expansion and land
conversion in other areas with weaker land use governance, less monitoring and lower
enforcement. [446] At the regional and local levels, pairing sustainable yields intensification
with governance and establishment of conservation areas is vital to preventing land use
expansion, conserving biodiversity in production landscapes, and protecting the wellbeing of indigenous communities and shareholders who are dependent on the land in
question. [447]
65
_**Restore, reforest and afforest degraded land**_
Where appropriate, restoration of degraded land can be promoted through financial
incentives for landholders to undertake restoration projects or even sanctions for
landholders who fail to initiate restoration of their land. [448] Active restoration techniques
include soil management, planting, or using thinning or burning as a means to speed up
vegetation recovery. These approaches have been favoured by decision-makers and
implementers in the past, yet they are often costly and not always best suited to the
area. [449] For example, in tropical forests, natural regeneration can perform better than
active restoration to promote biodiversity and natural vegetation structure. [449] Given
different contexts, policy makers should determine which approach, or what mix of
natural and active restoration approaches, are best suited for a specific ecological
conditions. [449] The global restoration movement could be supported through political
commitment to existing frameworks, such as the Bonn Challenge and the Convention
on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Targets. [450,451]
_**Manage oceans**_
Rigorous aquatic ecosystem governance is fundamental for protecting marine
biodiversity as well as ensuring ecosystem functions and a continued future supply of
wild seafood. **[21]** The ‘ecosystem approach to fisheries and aquaculture’ (EAF/EAA) [452,453]
should to be implemented, implying use of the Code of Conduct for Responsible
Fisheries. [454] Harmful subsidies to world fisheries will need to be removed, as these lead
to over-capacity of the global fishing fleet. [455] In accordance with SDG no 14, by 2020 at
least 10% of marine areas should be closed to fishing. Focus should lie on closure of
high seas areas, thereby using the high seas as a fish bank. This has the capacity to
greatly reduce the inequality of both volume and value distribution of global fisheries,
and simultaneously to increase net gains of most coastal countries, including the least
developed. [456] Other essential measures include a general prevention of overfishing and
application of the precautionary approach where lack of scientific information regarding
a fishery’s impact on marine species and ecosystems not is to be considered an excuse
for delaying crucial action. [453] Moreover, there is a need to manage future risks and
opportunities related to an anticipated aquaculture expansion. This includes
implementation of strict regulation on where to locate new operations, antibiotic and
chemical use, nutrient runoff and application of sustainably sourced feed from terrestrial
and marine origin. Seafood transparency and eco-certification schemes can also be
viable mechanisms for improving the performance of the expanding seafood sector. [457]
##### **Strategy five - at least halving food losses and waste, in line with** **global sustainable development goals**
Food losses and waste (FLW) occur at all stages along the food supply-chain, and
occur for different reasons in low-, middle and high-income countries, highlighting the
need for context-specific strategies. [335] Given the emphasis on food production and endconsumption in this report, the proposed actions to reduce FLW focus mainly on these
two extremities of the food life-cycle, though adopting a whole life-cycle approach to
FLW reductions will be necessary. [458] Governments, local officials, investors, producers,
researchers, innovators and private sector companies are needed to develop, finance
and support solutions across the supply chain. Particularly where the solutions are
expensive, resource intensive or implemented in low- or middle-income country
settings.
66
_**Improve post-harvest infrastructure, food transport, processing and packaging**_
FLW at the initial production stages are generally highest in low- and middle-income
countries. **[459,460]** These can result from poor harvest scheduling and timing, rough or
careless handling of produce or lack of market access. Inadequate cooling and storage
facilities can drive farmers to leave crops unharvested or in the fields, which thereby
increases the risk of rotting and contamination. Increased investment in post-harvest
infrastructure can help reduce some of these FLW. [461] Investment in processing
technologies such as drying and packaging solutions are also needed. Measures to
reduce FLW at intermediate stages of the food value chain are detailed elsewhere. [459]
_**Increase collaboration**_
Steep reductions in FLW will require cooperation among multiple food system actors in
order to assess sources of FLW and develop targeted solutions. Examples such as the
Save Food Initiative has been used to develop policies, strategies, programmes and
financing strategies for reducing FLW. [462] Infrastructural solutions include initiating
collective storage facilities, developing food processing technologies and infrastructure
or investing in cold chains. [459]
_**Train and equip producers**_
Growers can be encouraged to adopt on-farm practices to reduce FLW, such as good
animal hygiene (reducing the risk of contamination) or better harvesting and storage
techniques. To build this capacity of producers, investment in education, training and
extension services is needed. Given the high involvement on women in post-harvest
handling (along with many other activities), [463] these services should specifically be
designed to engage with and be accessed by women producers in developing
countries. [459]
_**Educate individuals**_
Particularly in highly-developed countries, the public is responsible for a large proportion
of food wasted. **[460]** The Commission envisages use of campaigns to promote better
planning of purchases, better understanding of ‘best before’ and ‘use by’ labels, better
storage practices, better evaluation of portions needed, better food preparation
techniques, and better knowledge of how to use ‘leftovers’.
_**Use public policy mechanisms**_
Appropriate public policy can be one mechanism to achieve the previously listed
actions. FLW can be incorporated into national waste policies, food safety policies, food
standards rules, food labelling regulations, food redistribution policies and food
subsidies. [459] Financial incentives or national waste reduction programs can encourage
collaboration or national innovation competitions among actors to reduce FLW in their
specific supply chains.
#### **Tools for a Great Food Transformation**
The evidence provided in this report suggests that the steps to begin this Great Food
Transformation should be taken quickly. Moving toward this Transformation requires
good data on each country’s status, across the various criteria and indicators that
capture the health of its population’s diets, and the sustainability of their food systems.
Each country or administrative unit – region, city, continent – must conduct
67
assessments of their diet and food system. These are essential for governance
mechanisms to deliver systemic change. Countries vary in current diets, the impact of
their food systems, and the particularities of their immediate challenges. Opportunities
to act inevitably differ across contexts. There are huge variations in resources, networks
of actors, institutions, and legislative tools available to support transformation.
In those countries that lack basic infrastructure and technologies that are given in the
developed world and which are basic precursors to sustainable food supplies, essential
non-food policies must first be developed and implemented. Despite these varying
starting points, there are common tools, outlined below, that can be used to spur the
Great Food Transformation.
**Clear articulation of goals**
While different priorities and pathways need to be tailored to different contexts, they all
need to encourage the global trajectory toward a single set of shared goals. The work of
this Commission has been to set scientific targets for both healthy diets and sustainable
food systems. Gaining consensus on these targets is a first step in galvanizing actors
around a common agenda. Then the targets will be refined and engaged with at all
policy levels.
**Adoption of an integrated approach**
Because these goals cross-cut political, sectoral and geographical boundaries, an
integrated approach is needed. An integrated policy approach means that everyone
works to progress a shared set of goals leading to healthy diets from sustainable food
systems. This will require working across siloes and making connections across all
sectors and parts of society. [407] Integrated approaches can be advanced by establishing
formal and frequent interactions between governing groups. For example, UN bodies
should facilitate inter-institutional working groups and meetings that focus on crosssectional issues, such as sustainable diets. Collaboration by FAO, UNEP, UNESCO,
and UNDP on the Intergovernmental Panel on Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is exploring
a specific assessment on food and food systems.
**Firm institutional leadership and governance**
Engineering change across the food system – if that is narrowly conceived as the
economics of supply chain management – is complex enough, but if multi-level, multiactor, multi-sector, multi-disciplinary change is required, this poses a serious challenge
to governance. In a world where many governments have adopted laissez-faire
approaches to consumer choice, the leadership now required by both governments and
food system actors is considerable. This demands co-ordination, consultation and good
policy facilitation by significant policy actors.
**Use of the full range levers – policy and otherwise**
Too often, attempts to change diet or food systems confine themselves to a soft policy
approach. Experience from other public health or environmental issues indicates that
education campaigns, community empowerment initiatives or private sector voluntary
commitments may be less effective than policy tools such as regulatory or fiscal
measures in generating sustained change, particularly when implemented in
isolation. [394] As was stated earlier, the full range needs to be available, from ‘hard’ to
‘soft’, from fiscal and legal measures to education and information measures. While
government has a crucial role, the private sector and civil society must be engaged,
68
using the levers and capacities which only they have such as marketing, thought
leadership, public engagement, supply data and management, quality control, and food
market data.
**Finance policy instruments that support healthy diets from sustainable food**
**systems**
Domestic spending will need to increase for policy instruments supporting healthy diets
from sustainable food systems. The lack of dedicated funding to support the
transformation toward more sustainable food systems is recognized as a critical barrier
to progress. [464] There are opportunities to leverage existing investment flows in
innovative ways in order to create multiple wins across the sustainable development
challenges we face today. Donors and multi-lateral organisations should be engaged,
and OECD reporting processes could be refined in order to better track this funding. [407]
**Unprecedented coordination of efforts**
A great challenge before us is building an alliance of progressive forces which can
operationalize the Commission’s broad recommendations. These alliances could
include actors at all stages of the food system as well as operate at all scales so that
local actions can be in line with global goals. In order to achieve a deeply integrated
agenda for food, alliances could focus on including both the ‘usual’ food system actors
(e.g. farmers, food industry and policy makers), as well as those actors working
primarily outside the realm of food systems but that have overlapping goals, e.g.
conservation, [465-467] anti-hunger, [468] animal welfare, [469,470] and social justice [471]
organizations. Such alliances can play a role in bolstering support for the agenda on
healthy diets from sustainable food systems and exert influence within and outside of
government.
**Curation of the evidence base**
There are extensive gaps in the evidence base regarding the effectiveness of actions
for shifting diets in more healthy and sustainable directions. Most actions to date have
aimed to improve health rather than environmental sustainability, with very few
designed to achieve multiple wins. Further knowledge gaps exist for low- and middleincome countries, where there is a dearth of evidence. [394]
**Regular monitoring and reporting**
At present, there are a number of existing annual official or officially approved reports by
reputable bodies. Some health-oriented reports might be broadened to include the
sustainability aspects or, vice versa, environmental or food security reports might
include stronger nutritional and cultural dimensions. The alternative would be the
initiation of a new annual or biannual healthy diets from sustainable food systems
report, the methodology for this would need to be replicable at national and other levels.
The development of sound metrics should not be allowed to become a reason to delay
better reporting. In addition, monitoring and reporting should go beyond lists of actions
and statistics of impacts to include regular synthesis and dissemination of lessons
learned. Transferable lessons should be spread widely to inspire action and to eliminate
‘reinventing’ the wheel.
**Establishment of evidence-based research co-ordination bodies**
Just as the lessons from the 1920s-40s led to the creation of new international food and
health institutions, so new ones may be needed today. Expert reports from existing
69
bodies such as UN Enviroment Programme, [331] the UN Committee on World Food
Security, [459] and UN Standing Committee on Nutrition have highlighted different aspects
of the agenda explored by this Commission such as food’s reliance on finite resources,
land pressures, diet as a driver of ecosystems damage. [472] Might the urgency of
recalibrating diet and sustainability of food systems be helped by a new champion? The
value of bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and
the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is that
they constantly champion the narrowing of the gap between scientific evidence and
policy-making. They deliver continual, high quality data collection, while being subject to
intergovernmental agreements, conventions and Conferences of the Parties (COP). The
Great Food Transformation can help meet existing binding agreements such as the
SDGs, the Paris Climate Change Accord, and elements of the WHO-FAO Decade of
Nutrition Action, but a specific new Convention or agreement is almost certainly needed,
too. The Commission recommends that international bodies review whether a new
oversight body or bodies might be needed, or whether existing bodies could coalesce or
have their remit and functions revised to provide the necessary focus on healthy diet for
all from sustainable food systems. The diet-sustainable food system connection tends to
get lost or seen as too big to tackle. Table 9 outlines possible research co-ordination
bodies. Although expensive, an international body specifically focusing on healthy diets
from sustainable food systems, akin to how the IPCC focuses on climate change could
play a key role in curating the evidence base, synthesizing and refining existing metrics
to assess healthy diets from sustainable food systems and to undertake regular
monitoring and reporting to governmental and other authorities. The Table outlines
other possibilities, too.
