**Knowledge of generative AI technologies**
As illustrated in Table 2, participants had a generally good understanding of GenAI
technologies, with mean scores ranging from 3.89 to 4.15. Specifically, students had
the highest mean score for the statement “I understand generative AI technologies
like ChatGPT have limitations in their ability to handle complex tasks” (Mean = 4.15,
SD = 0.82) and the lowest mean score for the emotional intelligence and empathy
considerations(Mean = 3.89, SD = 0.97), indicating that while they generally understand
GenAI technologies has limitations, they may not be fully aware of the potential risks
arise from the lack of emotional intelligence and empathy.
Moreover, the data showed a moderate positive correlation between their knowledge of GenAI technologies and frequency of use(r = 0.1, p < 0.05). Specifically, regarding their agreement on if GenAI technologies like ChatGPT may generate factually
inaccurate output, students who never or rarely use GenAI technologies (Mean = 3.99,
SD = 0.847) were significantly different (t = 2.695, p < 0.01) from students who have used
them at least sometimes (Mean = 4.22 SD = 0.829).

**Willingness to use generative AI technologies**
Overall, the findings suggest that students have a positive attitude toward GenAI technologies. They would like to integrate GenAI technologies like ChatGPT in their learning practices (Mean = 3.85, SD = 1.02), as well as future careers (Mean = 4.05; SD = 0.96).
Specifically, students highly value its perceived usefulness in providing unique insights
(Mean = 3.74; SD = 1.08) and personalized feedback (Mean = 3.61; SD = 1.06). Additionally, they find these technologies are user-friendly, as they are available 24/7(Mean = 4.12;
SD = 0.83) and offer anonymous support services (Mean = 3.77; SD = 0.99).
Moreover, the correlation analysis results show that students’ perceived willingness to use GenAI technologies is positively correlated with both knowledge of GenAI
(r = 0.189; p < 0.001) and frequency of use (r = 0.326; p < 0.001), indicating that students
who are more knowledgeable about these technologies and use them more frequently
are more likely to use them in the future (Tables 3, 4).
**Concerns about generative AI technologies**
Unlike willingness, descriptive statistics show that students expressed a slight favor of
concerns about GenAI. They expressed the least positive opinions about if people will
become over-reliant on GenAI technologies (Mean = 2.89; SD = 1.13), and the highest rating was for how these technologies could affect the value of university education
(Mean = 3.18; SD = 1.16).
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 9 of 18
Interestingly, there were significant differences between students who never or
rarely used these technologies and other participants (t = 3.873, p < 0.01). However,
no significant correlation was found between students’ concerns and knowledge
about GenAI technologies (r = 0.096; p > 0.05).
**The benefits and challenges for students’ willingness and concerns**
_**What are the reasons behind students’ willingness to utilise generative AI technologies?**_
Consistent with the findings from the quantitative data, most participants perceived
GenAI as a valuable tool with numerous benefits and were willing to work with it, primarily on learning, writing and research purposes:
1. Personalized and immediate learning support
When students struggle with assignments, GenAI can act as a virtual tutor, providing personalized learning support and answering their questions immediately. A student from the faculty of engineering considered AI as “ _a top student_ ” in their class,
because “ _When I have doubt and couldn’t find other people to help me out, ChatGPT_
_seems like a good option_ .” Besides immediate answers, customized recommendations
and feedback were also valued by students. As one remarked, “ _It would be useful if_
_ChatGPT could help me find the most effective solution when I am checking my fin-_
_ished homework. This way of using it would help me improve my depth of thinking and_
_understanding._ ” Feedback on submitted assignments is essential for students’ learning, but it also puts a lot of pressure on teachers, especially with a large number of
students. In this case, GenAI may be a solution.
Moreover, AI can also provide learning resources tailored to students’ specific needs.
For example, a student majoring in English proposed an innovative learning methods, using ChatGPT to learn a second language, “ _ChatGPT can generate short texts_
_based on the words entered by the user to help students memorize the words._ ” Moreover, some students from the Faculty of Education also assumed that AI can assist
them in future teaching, e.g., “ _I believe that the use of ChatGPT will reduce teachers’_
_workload for answering questions. I may also use it to generate some lesson plans._ ”
Since GenAI was considered to “ _improve students’ motivation” and “help students_
_learn better on their own”_, in the future, it may potentially revolutionize traditional
teaching and learning methods.
2. Writing and brainstorming support
GenAI technologies, such as ChatGPT, can also be used as writing assistants. Sometimes, students find it difficult to generate ideas or find inspiration. In such cases, a
participant suggested, “ _It’ll be convenient to ask ChatGPT some general questions and_
_even get inspired by it._ ” By inputting a question related to the writing topic, the AI
output can serve as a starting point to develop and expand on their ideas. In addition, this virtual assistant is equipped to provide technical support, for example, “ _it_
_can help with formatting and information retrieval_ “or “ _help gather citations._ ”, which
improves efficiency.
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 10 of 18
Furthermore, after writing, students can also use GenAI to enhance their writing
skills. As one remarked, “ _I would use it to help improve my writing (grammar, para-_
_phrasing…), consult some questions or let it give some feedback on my writing._ ” Especially for non-native English-speaking students who are struggling with writing, it
can be particularly useful if AI can “ _help polish articles_ ” and provide personalized
feedback for their written texts.
3. Research and analysis support
The role of GenAI technologies in research has also caught the attention of students.
In terms of its ability to acquire, compile, and consolidate information, some participants suggested it can “ _facilitate literature searching_,” “ _summarise readings,_ ” and
“ _even generate hypotheses based on data analysis._ ” With a vast amount of data and
knowledge, AI-powered technologies can help researchers always stay up-to-date
with the latest research trends. Moreover, it also contributes to data collection and
analysis. A student noted, “ _It saves resources in data collection and initial analysis._
_We should ride on the initial insights to build our own insights._ ” Since GenAI technologies are capable of rapidly and effectively processing large amounts of data, students
can directly work on the basis of the preliminary analysis results.
4. Visual and audio multi-media support
In addition to the above-mentioned uses, participants also used GenAI technologies for creating artworks and handling repetitive tasks. With advances in computer vision, AI-generated artworks have particularly gained attention from STEM
students. A student from the faculty of science mentioned, “ _I mainly played around_
_with DALL-E, stable diffusion and other AI art technologies, which generate images_
_based on a prompt._ ” Similarly, an engineering student “ _used text-to-image generation_
_AI like stable diffusion at home to create artwork_ .” Furthermore, AI technologies _can_
_facilitate “the production of multi-media”_, incluing slides, audios, and videos. As a
content creator, “ _when we have no clue how to visualize stuff, it can offer samples and_
_insights._ ”
5. Administrative support
Concerning “ _repetitive or non-creative_ ” tasks, some participants believe that AI will
perform well. As one commented, “ _tedious administrative work will be handled by AI_
_efficiently._ ” By accelerating routine repetitive tasks, AI may leave more time for students to focus on their studies and research.
_**What are the reasons behind students’ concerns or lack of concerns regarding generative AI**_
_**technologies?**_
In alignment with the quantitative results, the qualitative data similarly revealed different concerns regarding challenges about GenAI. Some participants were optimistic
about AI’s integration in the future. The reasons for this optimism include the willingness mentioned earlier, as well as the belief that GenAI is part of the evolution and trends
of technology. One student stated, “ _It follows a general revolution of technology, similar_
_to the public use of computers 40 years ago. I’m very much looking forward to the future_
_of how such technology can reshape the world_ ” They suggested that as new technologies
emerge, it is better to “ _positively embrace it_ ” rather than avoid them.
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 11 of 18
Another reason behind the optimism was the assumption that humans would still
maintain control and oversight over the GenAI. A participant remarked that “ _I am not_
_that concerned, as it would lead humans to smartly utilize such AI tools to complete their_
_tasks in an efficient manner rather than simply being replaced by such tools._ ” Another
postgraduate student from the Faculty of Arts emphasized that AI is not a replacement
for human skills and expertise: “ _to my best of knowledge, I feel ChatGPT has not yet had_
_the creativity and imagination as human beings, nor can it create a thesis for postgradu-_
_ate students._ ” At least for now, they believed humans would continue to be in the loop
and have oversight over the GenAI technologies.
However, more than half of the participants still have concerns about the challenges of
integrating GenAI technologies, mainly about the reliability of the technology itself and
its impact:
1. Challenges concerning accuracy and transparency
Currently, GenAI can promptly provide fluent and human-sounding responses, but
their accuracy cannot always be guaranteed. As one student pointed out, “ _We can-_
_not predict or accurately verify the accuracy or validity of AI generated information._
_Some people may be misled by false information._ ” Transparency is another significant
concern. For a majority of users, the AI system is complex and opaque, which makes
it difficult to understand how AI comes up with its decisions. “ _It is always dangerous_
_to use things you cannot understand_ ”, a student noted. As AI-driven conversations
become increasingly popular, remaining a “black box” may become an obstacle to
public trust.
2. Challenges concerning privacy and ethical issues
The use of GenAI also raised privacy and ethical concerns, which was mostly mentioned by students majored in arts and social science. They were worried that AI
would collect personal information from our messages. As a social science student
put forward, “ _AI technologies are too strong so that they can obtain our private infor-_
_mation easily.”_ Since these messages will be used to further improve the system, if
they are not properly protected, it “ _can pose privacy and security risks._ ”
Ethically, the plagiarism concern has been mentioned numerous times. Plagiarism
has long been a critical issue in academics. But, with the rapid development of GenAI
technologies, it has become increasingly difficult to identify plagiarized information.
As an art student remarked, “ _I want to know whether I am dealing with an AI bot or_
_AI-generated content. Right now, it is somewhat easy to detect, but as the technology_
_improves, it may not be so easy_ ”.
3. Challenges concerning holistic competencies
Regarding its impact on individuals and personal development, one of the main
issues is over-reliance on AI, which may hinder people’s growth, skills, and intellectual development over time. As one participant commented, “ _this may lead to a_
_decrease in critical thinking and make decisions only based on the information that_
_AI provides to them._ ” In addition to critical thinking, a student also noted its negative
impact on creativity, “ _some people may rely too much on AI technologies to generate_
_ideas causing them to lose the capacity or willingness to think by themselves._ ”
Chan and Hu _﻿Int J Educ Technol High Educ (2023) 20:43_ Page 12 of 18
4. Challenges concerning career prospects
Regarding its impact on society as a whole, GenAI also carries risks and drawbacks.
The most frequently mentioned concern is job replacement. As GenAI is transforming the workplace, some jobs that students are preparing for may disappear. A computer science student expressed his concern “ _I will probably lose my job in the future_
_due to the advent of ChatGPT_ .” Similarly, a student who majored in social science also
mentioned, “ _AI may replace the job that I’m interested in (e.g., GIS analyst)_ ”. Consequently, employers may also raise their recruitment requirements. This development
will pose a test for future graduates, since “ _those who fall behind on this might have_
_difficulty finding employment or catching up._ ”
5. Challenges concerning human values
Another mentioned societal risk relates to the value system. Some participants were
worried that “AI could misalign with our human values and becomes a danger to us.”
For example, it may contribute to social injustice and inequality, as some participants
noted, “ _it may widen the gap between the rich and the poor_ ” and “ _also be unfair to_
_those students who don’t use it_ .” Furthermore, in academic institutions and education,
some were concerned that the widespread use of AI might also might affect the student–teacher relationship, since students may be _“disappointed and lose respect for_
_teachers_ .”
6. Challenges concerning uncertain policies
Last but not least, students also expressed worries regarding the vacuum of institutional policies on the use of GenAI. Since the development of technology has outpaced regulatory measures, they were concerned about the potential risks such as
governance associated with Gen AI. As a student noted, “ _I am cautious. There should_
_be implementation strategies & plans to navigate with these technologies._ ” Uncertain
regulations could potentially result in the misuse or unintended consequences of
GenAI, which may pose risks to themselves and society. Even for some students who
acknowledge the positive effects of GenAI, they also believe that a policy is necessary
currently. One student pointed out, “ _A well-balanced usage guideline needs to be in_
_place so that the benefits of the tech can be leveraged.”_ Without institutional guidance,
students may feel at a loss for how to appropriately use GenAI in universities.
