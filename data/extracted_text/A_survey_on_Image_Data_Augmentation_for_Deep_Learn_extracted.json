Khoshgoftaar\nIntroduction\nDeep Learning models have made incredible progress in discriminative tasks. This has \nbeen fueled by the advancement of deep network architectures, powerful computation, \nand access to big data. Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to Computer Vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation thanks to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These neural \nnetworks utilize parameterized, sparsely connected kernels which preserve the spatial \ncharacteristics of images. Convolutional layers sequentially downsample the spatial \nresolution of images while expanding the depth of their feature maps. This series of \nconvolutional transformations can create much lower-dimensional and more useful representations of images than what could possibly be hand-crafted. The success of CNNs \nhas spiked interest and optimism in applying Deep Learning to Computer Vision tasks.\nAbstract \nDeep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many \nComputer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to \navoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a \nfunction with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical \nimage analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to \nthe problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques \nthat enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning \nmodels can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this \nsurvey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, \nmixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, \ngenerative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In \naddition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final \ndataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data \nAugmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing \nData Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve \nthe performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the \ncapabilities of big data.\nKeywords: Data Augmentation, Big data, Image data, Deep Learning, GANs\nOpen Access\n© The Author(s) 2019.

Improving the generalization ability of these models is one of the most difficult challenges. Generalizability refers \nto the performance difference of a model when evaluated on previously seen data (training data) versus data it has never seen before (testing data). Models with poor generalizability have overfitted the training data. One way to discover overfitting is to plot the \ntraining and validation accuracy at each epoch during training. The graph below depicts \nwhat overfitting might look like when visualizing these accuracies over training epochs \n(Fig. 1).\nTo build useful Deep Learning models, the validation error must continue to decrease \nwith the training error. Data Augmentation is a very powerful method of achieving this. \nThe augmented data will represent a more comprehensive set of possible data points, \nthus minimizing the distance between the training and validation set, as well as any \nfuture testing sets.\nData Augmentation, the focus of this survey, is not the only technique that has been \ndeveloped to reduce overfitting. The following few paragraphs will introduce other solutions available to avoid overfitting in Deep Learning models. This listing is intended to \ngive readers a broader understanding of the context of Data Augmentation.\nMany other strategies for increasing generalization performance focus on the model’s \narchitecture itself. This has led to a sequence of progressively more complex architectures from AlexNet [1] to VGG-16 [2], ResNet [3], Inception-V3 [4], and DenseNet [5]. \nFunctional solutions such as dropout regularization, batch normalization, transfer learning, and pretraining have been developed to try to extend Deep Learning for application \non smaller datasets. A brief description of these overfitting solutions is provided below. \nA complete survey of regularization methods in Deep Learning has been compiled by \nKukacka et al. [6]. Knowledge of these overfitting solutions will inform readers about \nother existing tools, thus framing the high-level context of Data Augmentation and Deep \nLearning.\n• Dropout [7] is a regularization technique that zeros out the activation values of randomly chosen neurons during training. This constraint forces the network to learn \nmore robust features rather than relying on the predictive capability of a small subset \nof neurons in the network. Tompson et al. [8] extended this idea to convolutional \nFig. 1 The plot on the left shows an inflection point where the validation error starts to increase as the \ntraining rate continues to decrease. The increased training has caused the model to overfit to the training \ndata and perform poorly on the testing set relative to the training set. In contrast, the plot on the right shows \na model with the desired relationship between training and testing error",

Normalization works by subtracting the batch mean from \neach activation and dividing by the batch standard deviation. This normalization \ntechnique, along with standardization, is a standard technique in the preprocessing \nof pixel values.\n• Transfer Learning [10, 11] is another interesting paradigm to prevent overfitting. \nTransfer Learning works by training a network on a big dataset such as ImageNet \n[12] and then using those weights as the initial weights in a new classification task. \nTypically, just the weights in convolutional layers are copied, rather than the entire \nnetwork including fully-connected layers. This is very effective since many image \ndatasets share low-level spatial characteristics that are better learned with big data. \nUnderstanding the relationship between transferred data domains is an ongoing \nresearch task [13]. Yosinski et al. [14] find that transferability is negatively affected \nprimarily by the specialization of higher layer neurons and difficulties with splitting \nco-adapted neurons.\n• Pretraining [15] is conceptually very similar to transfer learning. In Pretraining, the \nnetwork architecture is defined and then trained on a big dataset such as ImageNet \n[12]. This differs from Transfer Learning because in Transfer Learning, the network \narchitecture such as VGG-16 [2] or ResNet [3] must be transferred as well as the \nweights. Pretraining enables the initialization of weights using big datasets, while still \nenabling flexibility in network architecture design.\n• One-shot and Zero-shot learning [16, 17] algorithms represent another paradigm for \nbuilding models with extremely limited data. One-shot learning is commonly used \nin facial recognition applications [18]. An approach to one-shot learning is the use of \nsiamese networks [19] that learn a distance function such that image classification is \npossible even if the network has only been trained on one or a few instances. Another \nvery popular approach to one-shot learning is the use of memory-augmented networks [20]. Zero-shot learning is a more extreme paradigm in which a network uses \ninput and output vector embeddings such as Word2Vec [21] or GloVe [22] to classify \nimages based on descriptive attributes.\nIn contrast to the techniques mentioned above, Data Augmentation approaches \noverfitting from the root of the problem, the training dataset. This is done under the \nassumption that more information can be extracted from the original dataset through \naugmentations. These augmentations artificially inflate the training dataset size by \neither data warping or oversampling. Data warping augmentations transform existing images such that their label is preserved. This encompasses augmentations such as \ngeometric and color transformations, random erasing, adversarial training, and neural \nstyle transfer. Oversampling augmentations create synthetic instances and add them to \nthe training set. This includes mixing images, feature space augmentations, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Oversampling and Data Warping augmentations do \nnot form a mutually exclusive dichotomy. For example, GAN samples can be stacked \nwith random cropping to further inflate the dataset.

A quick taxonomy of the Data Augmentations \nis depicted below in Fig. 2.\nBefore discussing image augmentation techniques, it is useful to frame the context of \nthe problem and consider what makes image recognition such a difficult task in the first \nplace. In classic discriminative examples such as cat versus dog, the image recognition \nsoftware must overcome issues of viewpoint, lighting, occlusion, background, scale, and \nmore. The task of Data Augmentation is to bake these translational invariances into the \ndataset such that the resulting models will perform well despite these challenges.\nIt is a generally accepted notion that bigger datasets result in better Deep Learning \nmodels [23, 24]. However, assembling enormous datasets can be a very daunting task \ndue to the manual effort of collecting and labeling data. Limited datasets is an especially \nprevalent challenge in medical image analysis. Given big data, deep convolutional networks have been shown to be very powerful for medical image analysis tasks such as skin \nlesion classification as demonstrated by Esteva et al. [25]. This has inspired the use of \nCNNs on medical image analysis tasks [26] such as liver lesion classification, brain scan \nanalysis, continued research in skin lesion classification, and more. Many of the images \nstudied are derived from computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, both of which are expensive and labor-intensive to collect. It is especially difficult to build big medical image datasets due to the rarity of diseases, patient \nFig. 2 A taxonomy of image data augmentations covered; the colored lines in the figure depict which data \naugmentation method the corresponding meta-learning scheme uses, for example, meta-learning using \nNeural Style Transfer is covered in neural augmentation [36]",

These obstacles have led to many \nstudies on image Data Augmentation, especially GAN-based oversampling, from the \napplication perspective of medical image classification.\nMany studies on the effectiveness of Data Augmentation utilize popular academic \nimage datasets to benchmark results. These datasets include MNIST hand written digit \nrecognition, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, tiny-imagenet-200, SVHN (street view house \nnumbers), Caltech-101/256, MIT places, MIT-Adobe 5K dataset, Pascal VOC, and Stanford Cars. The datasets most frequently discussed are CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The expansion of open-source datasets has given researchers a wide variety of \ncases to compare performance results of Data Augmentation techniques. Most of these \ndatasets such as ImageNet would be classified as big data. Many experiments constrain \nthemselves to a subset of the dataset to simulate limited data problems.\nIn addition to our focus on limited datasets, we will also consider the problem of class \nimbalance and how Data Augmentation can be a useful oversampling solution. Class \nimbalance describes a dataset with a skewed ratio of majority to minority samples. Leevy \net al. [27] describe many of the existing solutions to high-class imbalance across data \ntypes. Our survey will show how class-balancing oversampling in image data can be \ndone with Data Augmentation.\nMany aspects of Deep Learning and neural network models draw comparisons with \nhuman intelligence. For example, a human intelligence anecdote of transfer learning is \nillustrated in learning music. If two people are trying to learn how to play the guitar, and \none already knows how to play the piano, it seems likely that the piano-player will learn \nto play the guitar faster. Analogous to learning music, a model that can classify ImageNet images will likely perform better on CIFAR-10 images than a model with random \nweights.\nData Augmentation is similar to imagination or dreaming. Humans imagine different scenarios based on experience. Imagination helps us gain a better understanding \nof our world. Data Augmentation methods such as GANs and Neural Style Transfer \ncan ‘imagine’ alterations to images such that they have a better understanding of them. \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: A brief “Background” is provided \nto give readers a historical context of Data Augmentation and Deep Learning. “Image \nData Augmentation techniques” discusses each image augmentation technique in detail \nalong with experimental results. “Design considerations for image Data Augmentation” \ndiscusses additional characteristics of augmentation such as test-time augmentation \nand the impact of image resolution. The paper concludes with a “Discussion” of the presented material, areas of “Future work”, and “Conclusion”.\nBackground\nImage augmentation in the form of data warping can be found in LeNet-5 [28]. This \nwas one of the first applications of CNNs on handwritten digit classification. Data \naugmentation has also been investigated in oversampling applications. Oversampling \nis a technique used to re-sample imbalanced class distributions such that the model \nis not overly biased towards labeling instances as the majority class type.

Intelligent oversampling techniques date back to SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which \nwas developed by Chawla et al. [29]. SMOTE and the extension of Borderline-SMOTE \n[30] create new instances by interpolating new points from existing instances via \nk-Nearest Neighbors. The primary focus of this technique was to alleviate problems \ndue to class imbalance, and SMOTE was primarily used for tabular and vector data.\nThe AlexNet CNN architecture developed by Krizhevsky et al. [1] revolutionized \nimage classification by applying convolutional networks to the ImageNet dataset. \nData Augmentation is used in their experiments to increase the dataset size by a \nmagnitude of 2048. This is done by randomly cropping 224 × 224 patches from the \noriginal images, flipping them horizontally, and changing the intensity of the RGB \nchannels using PCA color augmentation. This Data Augmentation helped reduce \noverfitting when training a deep neural network. The authors claim that their augmentations reduced the error rate of the model by over 1%.\nSince then, GANs were introduced in 2014 [31], Neural Style Transfer [32] in 2015, \nand Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [33] in 2017. Various works on GAN extensions such as DCGANs, CycleGANs and Progressively-Growing GANs [34] were published in 2015, 2017, and 2017, respectively. Neural Style Transfer was sped up with \nthe development of Perceptual Losses by Johnson et al. [35] in 2016. Applying metalearning concepts from NAS to Data Augmentation has become increasingly popular \nwith works such as Neural Augmentation [36], Smart Augmentation [37], and AutoAugment [38] published in 2017, 2017, and 2018, respectively.\nApplying Deep Learning to medical imaging has been a popular application for \nCNNs since they became so popular in 2012. Deep Learning and medical imaging \nbecame increasingly popular with the demonstration of dermatologist-level skin cancer detection by Esteva et al. [25] in 2017.\nThe use of GANs in medical imaging is well documented in a survey by Yi et al. \n[39]. This survey covers the use of GANs in reconstruction such as CT denoising [40], \naccelerated magnetic resonance imaging [41], PET denoising [42], and the application of super-resolution GANs in retinal vasculature segmentation [43]. Additionally, \nYi et al. [39] cover the use of GAN image synthesis in medical imaging applications \nsuch as brain MRI synthesis [44, 45], lung cancer diagnosis [46], high-resolution skin \nlesion synthesis [47], and chest x-ray abnormality classification [48]. GAN-based \nimage synthesis Data Augmentation was used by Frid-Adar et al. [49] in 2018 for liver \nlesion classification. This improved classification performance from 78.6% sensitivity and 88.4% specificity using classic augmentations to 85.7% sensitivity and 92.4% \nspecificity using GAN-based Data Augmentation.\nMost of the augmentations covered focus on improving Image Recognition models. Image Recognition is when a model predicts an output label such as ‘dog’ or ‘cat’ \ngiven an input image.\nHowever, it is possible to extend results from image recognition to other Computer \nVision tasks such as Object Detection led by the algorithms YOLO [50], R-CNN [51], \nfast R-CNN [52], and faster R-CNN [53] or Semantic Segmentation [54] including \nalgorithms such as U-Net [55].",

These transformations encode many of the invariances discussed earlier that present challenges to image recognition tasks. The augmentations listed in this \nsurvey are geometric transformations, color space transformations, kernel filters, mixing \nimages, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, GAN-based \naugmentation, neural style transfer, and meta-learning schemes. This section will explain \nhow each augmentation algorithm works, report experimental results, and discuss disadvantages of the augmentation technique.\nData Augmentations based on basic image manipulations\nGeometric transformations\nThis section describes different augmentations based on geometric transformations and \nmany other image processing functions. The class of augmentations discussed below \ncould be characterized by their ease of implementation. Understanding these transformations will provide a useful base for further investigation into Data Augmentation \ntechniques.\nWe will also describe the different geometric augmentations in the context of their \n‘safety’ of application. The safety of a Data Augmentation method refers to its likelihood \nof preserving the label post-transformation. For example, rotations and flips are generally safe on ImageNet challenges such as cat versus dog, but not safe for digit recognition tasks such as 6 versus 9. A non-label preserving transformation could potentially \nstrengthen the model’s ability to output a response indicating that it is not confident \nabout its prediction. However, achieving this would require refined labels [56] post-augmentation. If the label of the image after a non-label preserving transformation is something like [0.5 0.5], the model could learn more robust confidence predictions. However, \nconstructing refined labels for every non-safe Data Augmentation is a computationally \nexpensive process.\nDue to the challenge of constructing refined labels for post-augmented data, it is \nimportant to consider the ‘safety’ of an augmentation. This is somewhat domain dependent, providing a challenge for developing generalizable augmentation policies, (see AutoAugment [38] for further exploration into finding generalizable augmentations). There \nis no image processing function that cannot result in a label changing transformation \nat some distortion magnitude. This demonstrates the data-specific design of augmentations and the challenge of developing generalizable augmentation policies. This is an \nimportant consideration with respect to the geometric augmentations listed below.\nFlipping\nHorizontal axis flipping is much more common than flipping the vertical axis. This augmentation is one of the easiest to implement and has proven useful on datasets such \nas CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. On datasets involving text recognition such as MNIST or \nSVHN, this is not a label-preserving transformation.",

Performing augmentations in the color channels space is another strategy \nthat is very practical to implement. Very simple color augmentations include isolating \na single color channel such as R, G, or B. An image can be quickly converted into its \nrepresentation in one color channel by isolating that matrix and adding 2 zero matrices \nfrom the other color channels. Additionally, the RGB values can be easily manipulated \nwith simple matrix operations to increase or decrease the brightness of the image. More \nadvanced color augmentations come from deriving a color histogram describing the \nimage. Changing the intensity values in these histograms results in lighting alterations \nsuch as what is used in photo editing applications.\nCropping\nCropping images can be used as a practical processing step for image data with mixed \nheight and width dimensions by cropping a central patch of each image. Additionally, \nrandom cropping can also be used to provide an effect very similar to translations. \nThe contrast between random cropping and translations is that cropping will reduce \nthe size of the input such as (256,256) → (224, 224), whereas translations preserve the \nspatial dimensions of the image. Depending on the reduction threshold chosen for \ncropping, this might not be a label-preserving transformation.\nRotation\nRotation augmentations are done by rotating the image right or left on an axis \nbetween 1° and 359°. The safety of rotation augmentations is heavily determined by \nthe rotation degree parameter. Slight rotations such as between 1 and 20 or − 1 to \n− 20 could be useful on digit recognition tasks such as MNIST, but as the rotation \ndegree increases, the label of the data is no longer preserved post-transformation.\nTranslation\nShifting images left, right, up, or down can be a very useful transformation to avoid \npositional bias in the data. For example, if all the images in a dataset are centered, \nwhich is common in face recognition datasets, this would require the model to be \ntested on perfectly centered images as well. As the original image is translated in a \ndirection, the remaining space can be filled with either a constant value such as 0 s or \n255 s, or it can be filled with random or Gaussian noise. This padding preserves the \nspatial dimensions of the image post-augmentation.\nNoise injection\nNoise injection consists of injecting a matrix of random values usually drawn from a \nGaussian distribution. Noise injection is tested by Moreno-Barea et al. [57] on nine \ndatasets from the UCI repository [58]. Adding noise to images can help CNNs learn \nmore robust features.\nGeometric transformations are very good solutions for positional biases present in \nthe training data.

If positional biases are present, such as in a facial recognition dataset where every face is perfectly centered in \nthe frame, geometric transformations are a great solution. In addition to their powerful ability to overcome positional biases, geometric transformations are also useful because they are easily implemented. There are many imaging processing libraries \nthat make operations such as horizontal flipping and rotation painless to get started \nwith. Some of the disadvantages of geometric transformations include additional \nmemory, transformation compute costs, and additional training time. Some geometric transformations such as translation or random cropping must be manually \nobserved to make sure they have not altered the label of the image. Finally, in many of \nthe application domains covered such as medical image analysis, the biases distancing \nthe training data from the testing data are more complex than positional and translational variances. Therefore, the scope of where and when geometric transformations \ncan be applied is relatively limited.\nColor space transformations\nImage data is encoded into 3 stacked matrices, each of size height × width. These matrices represent pixel values for an individual RGB color value. Lighting biases are amongst \nthe most frequently occurring challenges to image recognition problems. Therefore, the \neffectiveness of color space transformations, also known as photometric transformations, is fairly intuitive to conceptualize. A quick fix to overly bright or dark images is to \nloop through the images and decrease or increase the pixel values by a constant value. \nAnother quick color space manipulation is to splice out individual RGB color matrices. \nAnother transformation consists of restricting pixel values to a certain min or max value. \nThe intrinsic representation of color in digital images lends itself to many strategies of \naugmentation.\nColor space transformations can also be derived from image-editing apps. An image’s \npixel values in each RGB color channel is aggregated to form a color histogram. This histogram can be manipulated to apply filters that change the color space characteristics of \nan image.\nThere is a lot of freedom for creativity with color space augmentations. Altering the \ncolor distribution of images can be a great solution to lighting challenges faced by testing \ndata (Figs. 3, 4).\nImage datasets can be simplified in representation by converting the RGB matrices into a single grayscale image. This results in smaller images, height × width × 1, \nFig. 3 Examples of Color Augmentations provided by Mikolajczyk and Grochowski [72] in the domain of \nmelanoma classification",

[59] found a ~ 3% classification accuracy drop \nbetween grayscale and RGB images with their experiments on ImageNet [12] and \nthe PASCAL [60] VOC dataset. In addition to RGB versus grayscale images, there \nare many other ways of representing digital color such as HSV (Hue, Saturation, and \nValue). Jurio et al. [61] explore the performance of Image Segmentation on many different color space representations from RGB to YUV, CMY, and HSV.\nSimilar to geometric transformations, a disadvantage of color space transformations is increased memory, transformation costs, and training time. Additionally, \ncolor transformations may discard important color information and thus are not \nalways a label-preserving transformation. For example, when decreasing the pixel \nvalues of an image to simulate a darker environment, it may become impossible to \nsee the objects in the image. Another indirect example of non-label preserving color \ntransformations is in Image Sentiment Analysis [62]. In this application, CNNs try \nto visually predict the sentiment score of an image such as: highly negative, negative, neutral, positive, or highly positive. One indicator of a negative/highly negative \nimage is the presence of blood. The dark red color of blood is a key component to \ndistinguish blood from water or paint. If color space transforms repeatedly change \nthe color space such that the model cannot recognize red blood from green paint, \nthe model will perform poorly on Image Sentiment Analysis. In effect, color space \ntransformations will eliminate color biases present in the dataset in favor of spatial characteristics. However, for some tasks, color is a very important distinctive \nfeature.\nFig. 4 Examples of color augmentations tested by Wu et al. [127]",

The geometric transformations studied were flipping, − 30° to 30° rotations, and cropping. The color space transformations \nstudied were color jittering, (random color manipulation), edge enhancement, and PCA. \nThey tested these augmentations with 4-fold cross-validation on the Caltech101 dataset \nfiltered to 8421 images of size 256 × 256 (Table 1).\nKernel filters\nKernel filters are a very popular technique in image processing to sharpen and blur \nimages. These filters work by sliding an n × n matrix across an image with either a Gaussian blur filter, which will result in a blurrier image, or a high contrast vertical or horizontal edge filter which will result in a sharper image along edges. Intuitively, blurring \nimages for Data Augmentation could lead to higher resistance to motion blur during \ntesting. Additionally, sharpening images for Data Augmentation could result in encapsulating more details about objects of interest.\nSharpening and blurring are some of the classical ways of applying kernel filters to \nimages. Kang et  al. [64] experiment with a unique kernel filter that randomly swaps \nthe pixel values in an n × n sliding window. They call this augmentation technique \nPatchShuffle Regularization. Experimenting across different filter sizes and probabilities \nof shuffling the pixels at each step, they demonstrate the effectiveness of this by achieving a 5.66% error rate on CIFAR-10 compared to an error rate of 6.33% achieved without the use of PatchShuffle Regularization. The hyperparameter settings that achieved \nthis consisted of 2 × 2 filters and a 0.05 probability of swapping. These experiments were \ndone using the ResNet [3] CNN architecture (Figs. 5, 6).\nKernel filters are a relatively unexplored area for Data Augmentation. A disadvantage \nof this technique is that it is very similar to the internal mechanisms of CNNs. CNNs \nhave parametric kernels that learn the optimal way to represent images layer-by-layer. \nFor example, something like PatchShuffle Regularization could be implemented with a \nconvolution layer. This could be achieved by modifying the standard convolution layer \nparameters such that the padding parameters preserve spatial resolution and the subsequent activation layer keeps pixel values between 0 and 255, in contrast to something \nlike a sigmoid activation which maps pixels to values between 0 and 1.

The images produced by doing this will not look like a \nuseful transformation to a human observer. However, Ionue [65] demonstrated how the \npairing of samples could be developed into an effective augmentation strategy. In this \nexperiment, two images are randomly cropped from 256 × 256 to 224 × 224 and randomly flipped horizontally. These images are then mixed by averaging the pixel values \nfor each of the RGB channels. This results in a mixed image which is used to train a classification model. The label assigned to the new image is the same as the first randomly \nselected image (Fig. 7).\nOn the CIFAR-10 dataset, Ionue reported a reduction in error rate from 8.22 to 6.93% \nwhen using the SamplePairing Data Augmentation technique. The researcher found \neven better results when testing a reduced size dataset, reducing CIFAR-10 to 1000 total \nsamples with 100 in each class. With the reduced size dataset, SamplePairing resulted in \nan error rate reduction from 43.1 to 31.0%. The reduced CIFAR-10 results demonstrate \nthe usefulness of the SamplePairing technique in limited data applications (Fig. 8).\nAnother detail found in the study is that better results were obtained when mixing \nimages from the entire training set rather than from instances exclusively belonging \nto the same class. Starting from a training set of size N, SamplePairing produces a \ndataset of size N2 + N. In addition, Sample Pairing can be stacked on top of other \naugmentation techniques.

These kinds of strategies are discussed further in Design Considerations of Data Augmentation with respect to curriculum learning [69]. Additionally, \nthe paper will cover a meta-learning technique developed by Lemley et al. [37] that uses \na neural network to learn an optimal mixing of images.\nRandom erasing\nRandom erasing [70] is another interesting Data Augmentation technique developed \nby Zhong et al. Inspired by the mechanisms of dropout regularization, random erasing \ncan be seen as analogous to dropout except in the input data space rather than embedded into the network architecture. This technique was specifically designed to combat \nimage recognition challenges due to occlusion. Occlusion refers to when some parts of \nthe object are unclear. Random erasing will stop this by forcing the model to learn more \ndescriptive features about an image, preventing it from overfitting to a certain visual feature in the image. Aside from the visual challenge of occlusion, in particular, random \nerasing is a promising technique to guarantee a network pays attention to the entire \nimage, rather than just a subset of it.\nRandom erasing works by randomly selecting an n × m patch of an image and masking \nit with either 0 s, 255 s, mean pixel values, or random values. On the CIFAR-10 dataset \nthis resulted in an error rate reduction from 5.17 to 4.31%. The best patch fill method \nwas found to be random values. The fill method and size of the masks are the only \nparameters that need to be hand-designed during implementation (Figs. 11, 12).\nRandom erasing is a Data Augmentation method that seeks to directly prevent overfitting by altering the input space. By removing certain input patches, the model is forced \nto find other descriptive characteristics. This augmentation method can also be stacked \non top of other augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping or color filters. Random erasing produced one of the highest accuracies on the CIFAR-10 dataset. DeVries \nand Taylor [71] conducted a similar study called Cutout Regularization. Like the random \nerasing study, they experimented with randomly masking regions of the image (Table 2).\nMikolajcyzk and Grochowski [72] presented an interesting idea to combine random \nerasing with GANs designed for image inpainting. Image inpainting describes the task of \nFig. 11 Example of random erasing on image recognition tasks [70]",

Using a diverse collection of GAN inpainters, the \nrandom erasing augmentation could seed very interesting extrapolations. It will be interesting to see if better results can be achieved by erasing different shaped patches such \nas circles rather than n × m rectangles. An extension of this will be to parameterize the \ngeometries of random erased patches and learn an optimal erasing configuration.\nA disadvantage to random erasing is that it will not always be a label-preserving transformation. In handwritten digit recognition, if the top part of an ‘8’ is randomly cropped \nout, it is not any different from a ‘6’. In many fine-grained tasks such as the Stanford Cars \ndataset [73], randomly erasing sections of the image (logo, etc.) may make the car brand \nunrecognizable. Therefore, some manual intervention may be necessary depending on \nthe dataset and task.\nA note on combining augmentations\nOf the augmentations discussed, geometric transformations, color space transformations, kernel filters, mixing images, and random erasing, nearly all of these transformations come with an associated distortion magnitude parameter as well. This parameter \nencodes the distortional difference between a 45° rotation and a 30° rotation. With a \nlarge list of potential augmentations and a mostly continuous space of magnitudes, it is \neasy to conceptualize the enormous size of the augmentation search space.

In \ndomains with very limited data, this could result in further overfitting. Therefore, it is \nimportant to consider search algorithms for deriving an optimal subset of augmented \ndata to train Deep Learning models with. More on this topic will be discussed in Design \nConsiderations of Data Augmentation.\nData Augmentations based on Deep Learning\nFeature space augmentation\nAll of the augmentation methods discussed above are applied to images in the input \nspace. Neural networks are incredibly powerful at mapping high-dimensional inputs into \nlower-dimensional representations. These networks can map images to binary classes \nor to n × 1 vectors in flattened layers. The sequential processing of neural networks can \nbe manipulated such that the intermediate representations can be separated from the \nnetwork as a whole. The lower-dimensional representations of image data in fully-connected layers can be extracted and isolated. Konno and Iwazume [74] find a performance \nboost on CIFAR-100 from 66 to 73% accuracy by manipulating the modularity of neural \nnetworks to isolate and refine individual layers after training. Lower-dimensional representations found in high-level layers of a CNN are known as the feature space. DeVries \nand Taylor [75] presented an interesting paper discussing augmentation in this feature \nspace. This opens up opportunities for many vector operations for Data Augmentation.\nSMOTE is a popular augmentation used to alleviate problems with class imbalance. \nThis technique is applied to the feature space by joining the k nearest neighbors to form \nnew instances. DeVries and Taylor discuss adding noise, interpolating, and extrapolating \nas common forms of feature space augmentation (Figs. 13, 14).\nFig. 13 Architecture diagram of the feature space augmentation framework presented by DeVries and Taylor \n[75]\nFig. 14 Examples of interpolated instances in the feature space on the handwritten  character [75]",

Autoencoders work by having one half of the network, the encoder, \nmap images into low-dimensional vector representations such that the other half of the \nnetwork, the decoder, can reconstruct these vectors back into the original image. This \nencoded representation is used for feature space augmentation.\nDeVries and Taylor [75] tested their feature space augmentation technique by extrapolating between the 3 nearest neighbors per sample to generate new data and compared \ntheir results against extrapolating in the input space and using affine transformations in \nthe input space (Table 3).\nFeature space augmentations can be implemented with auto-encoders if it is necessary \nto reconstruct the new instances back into input space. It is also possible to do feature \nspace augmentation solely by isolating vector representations from a CNN. This is done \nby cutting off the output layer of the network, such that the output is a low-dimensional \nvector rather than a class label. Vector representations are then found by training a CNN \nand then passing the training set through the truncated CNN. These vector representations can be used to train any machine learning model from Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or back to a fully-connected multilayer network. The effectiveness of this \ntechnique is a subject for future work.\nA disadvantage of feature space augmentation is that it is very difficult to interpret the \nvector data. It is possible to recover the new vectors into images using an auto-encoder \nnetwork; however, this requires copying the entire encoding part of the CNN being \ntrained. For deep CNNs, this results in massive auto-encoders which are very difficult \nand time-consuming to train. Finally, Wong et al. [76] find that when it is possible to \ntransform images in the data-space, data-space augmentation will outperform feature \nspace augmentation.\nAdversarial training\nOne of the solutions to search the space of possible augmentations is adversarial \ntraining. Adversarial training is a framework for using two or more networks with \ncontrasting objectives encoded in their loss functions. This section will discuss using \nadversarial training as a search algorithm as well as the phenomenon of adversarial \nattacking. Adversarial attacking consists of a rival network that learns augmentations \nto images that result in misclassifications in its rival classification network. These \nadversarial attacks, constrained to noise injections, have been surprisingly successful \nfrom the perspective of the adversarial network. This is surprising because it completely defies intuition about how these models represent images.

This is well demonstrated by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [77] \nusing DeepFool, a network that finds the minimum possible noise injection needed \nto cause a misclassification with high confidence. Su et al. [78] show that 70.97% of \nimages can be misclassified by changing just one pixel. Zajac et al. [79] cause misclassifications with adversarial attacks limited to the border of images. The success of \nadversarial attacks is especially exaggerated as the resolution of images increases.\nAdversarial attacking can be targeted or untargeted, referring to the deliberation \nin which the adversarial network is trying to cause misclassifications. Adversarial \nattacks can help to illustrate weak decision boundaries better than standard classification metrics can.\nIn addition to serving as an evaluation metric, defense to adversarial attacks, adversarial training can be an effective method for searching for augmentations.\nBy constraining the set of augmentations and distortions available to an adversarial \nnetwork, it can learn to produce augmentations that result in misclassifications, thus \nforming an effective search algorithm. These augmentations are valuable for strengthening weak spots in the classification model. Therefore, adversarial training can be \nan effective search technique for Data Augmentation. This is in heavy contrast to the \ntraditional augmentation techniques described previously. Adversarial augmentations \nmay not represent examples likely to occur in the test set, but they can improve weak \nspots in the learned decision boundary.\nEngstrom et  al. [80] showed that simple transformations such as rotations and \ntranslations can easily cause misclassifications by deep CNN models. The worst out \nof the random transformations reduced the accuracy of MNIST by 26%, CIFAR10 by \n72% and ImageNet (Top 1) by 28%. Goodfellow et al.

Using a technique for \ngenerating adversarial examples known as the “fast gradient sign method”, a maxout \nnetwork [82] misclassified 89.4% of adversarial examples with an average confidence \nof 97.6%. This test is done on the MNIST dataset. With adversarial training, the error \nrate of adversarial examples fell from 89.4% to 17.9% (Fig. 15).\nLi et al.

However, it does significantly improve the test accuracy of adversarial \nexamples. Adversarial defense is a very interesting subject for evaluating security and \nrobustness of Deep Learning models. Improving on the Fast Gradient Sign Method, \nDeepFool, developed by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [77], uses a neural network to find the \nsmallest possible noise perturbation that causes misclassifications.\nAnother interesting framework that could be used in an adversarial training context is \nto have an adversary change the labels of training data. Xie et al. [84] presented DisturbLabel, a regularization technique that randomly replaces labels at each iteration. This \nis a rare example of adding noise to the loss layer, whereas most of the other augmentation methods discussed add noise into the input or hidden representation layers. On the \nMNIST dataset with LeNet [28] CNN architecture, DisturbLabel produced a 0.32% error \nrate compared to a baseline error rate of 0.39%. DisturbLabel combined with Dropout \nRegularization produced a 0.28% error rate compared to the 0.39% baseline. To translate \nthis to the context of adversarial training, one network takes in the classifier’s training \ndata as input and learns which labels to flip to maximize the error rate of the classification network.\nThe effectiveness of adversarial training in the form of noise or augmentation search is \nstill a relatively new concept that has not been widely tested and understood. Adversarial \nsearch to add noise has been shown to improve performance on adversarial examples, \nbut it is unclear if this is useful for the objective of reducing overfitting. Future work \nseeks to expand on the relationship between resistance to adversarial attacks and actual \nperformance on test datasets.\nGAN‑based Data Augmentation\nAnother exciting strategy for Data Augmentation is generative modeling. Generative modeling refers to the practice of creating artificial instances from a dataset such \nthat they retain similar characteristics to the original set. The principles of adversarial \ntraining discussed above have led to the very interesting and massively popular generative modeling framework known as GANs. Bowles et al. [85] describe GANs as a way \nto “unlock” additional information from a dataset.

The GAN framework can be extended to improve the quality of samples \nproduced with variational auto-encoders [86]. Variational auto-encoders learn a lowdimensional representation of data points. In the image domain, this translates an image \ntensor of size height × width × color channels down into a vector of size n × 1, identical to what was discussed with respect to feature space augmentation. Low-dimensional \nconstraints in vector representations will result in a poorer representation, although \nthese constraints are better for visualization using methods such as t-SNE [87]. Imagine a vector representation of size 5 × 1 created by an autoencoder. These autoencoders \ncan take in a distribution of labeled data and map them into this space. These classes \ncould include ‘head turned left’, ‘centered head’, and ‘head turned right’. The auto-encoder \nlearns a low-dimensional representation of these data points such that vector operations \nsuch as adding and subtracting can be used to simulate a front view-3D rotation of a new \ninstance. Variational auto-encoder outputs can be further improved by inputting them \ninto GANs [31]. Additionally, a similar vector manipulation process can be done on the \nnoise vector inputs to GANs through the use of Bidirectional GANs [88].\nThe impressive performance of GANs has resulted in increased attention on how they \ncan be applied to the task of Data Augmentation. These networks have the ability to generate new training data that results in better performing classification models. The GAN \narchitecture first proposed by Ian Goodfellow [31] is a framework for generative modeling through adversarial training. The best anecdote for understanding GANs is the analogy of a cop and a counterfeiter. The counterfeiter (generator network) takes in some \nform of input. This could be a random vector, another image, text, and many more. The \ncounterfeiter learns to produce money such that the cop (discriminator network) cannot \ntell if the money is real or fake. The real or fake dichotomy is analogous to whether or \nnot the generated instance is from the training set or if it was created by the generator \nnetwork (Fig. 16).\nThe counterfeiter versus robber analogy is a seamless bridge to understand GANs \nin the context of network intrusion detection. Lin et al. [89] use a generator network \nto learn how to fool a black-box detection system. This highlights one of the most \ninteresting characteristics of GANs. Analysis tools derived from game theory such as \nminimax strategy and the Nash Equilibrium [90] suggest that the generator will eventually fool the discriminator. The success of the generator to overcome the discriminator makes it very powerful for generative modeling. GANs are the most promising \ngenerative modeling technique for use in Data Augmentation.\nFig. 16 Illustration of GAN concept provided by Mikolajczyk and Grochowski [72]",

This is able to produce acceptable images on \na simple image dataset such as the MNIST handwritten digits. However, it fails \nto produce quality results for higher resolution, more complicated datasets. In \nthe MNIST dataset, each image is only 28 × 28 × 1 for a total of 784 pixels. GANs \napplied to the MNIST data are able to produce convincing results. However, MNIST \nimages are far less challenging than other image datasets due to low intra-class variance and resolution, to name a couple differences of many. This is in heavy contrast \nwith other datasets studied in most academic Computer Vision papers such as ImageNet or CIFAR-10. For immediate reference, an ImageNet image is of resolution \n256 × 256 × 3, totaling 196,608 pixels, a 250× increase in pixel count compared with \nMNIST.\nMany research papers have been published that modify the GAN framework \nthrough different network architectures, loss functions, evolutionary methods, and \nmany more. This research has significantly improved the quality of samples created by \nGANs. There have been many new architectures proposed for expanding on the concept of GANs and producing higher resolution output images, many of which are out \nof the scope of this paper. Amongst these new architectures, DCGANs, Progressively \nGrowing GANs, CycleGANs, and Conditional GANs seem to have the most application potential in Data Augmentation.\nThe DCGAN [91] architecture was proposed to expand on the internal complexity of the generator and discriminator networks. This architecture uses CNNs for \nthe generator and discriminator networks rather than multilayer perceptrons. The \nDCGAN was tested to generate results on the LSUN interior bedroom image dataset, each image being 64 × 64 × 3, for a total of 12,288 pixels, (compared to 784 in \nMNIST). The idea behind DCGAN is to increase the complexity of the generator \nnetwork to project the input into a high dimensional tensor and then add deconvolutional layers to go from the projected tensor to an output image. These deconvolutional layers will expand on the spatial dimensions, for example, going from \n14 × 14 × 6 to 28 × 28 × 1, whereas a convolutional layer will decrease the spatial \ndimensions such as going from 14 × 14 × 32 to 7 × 7 × 64. The DCGAN architecture \npresents a strategy for using convolutional layers in the GAN framework to produce \nhigher resolution images (Figs. 17, 18).\nFig. 17 DCGAN, generator architecture presented by Radford et al.

They use the architecture pictured above to generate 64 × 64 × 1 \nsize images of liver lesion CT scans. Their original dataset contains 182 CT scans, (53 \nCysts, 64 Metastases, and 65 Hemangiomas). After using classical augmentations to \nachieve 78.6% sensitivity and 88.4% specificity, they observed an increase to 85.7% sensitivity and 92.4% specificity once they added the DCGAN-generated samples.\nAnother architecture of interest is known as Progressively Growing GANs [34]. This \narchitecture trains a series of networks with progressive resolution complexity. These \nresolutions range from 4 × 4 to 8 × 8 and so on until outputs of size 1024 × 1024 are \nachieved. This is built on the concept that GANs can accept images as input as well \nas random vectors. Therefore, the series of GANs work by passing samples from a \nlower resolution GAN up to higher-resolution GANs. This has produced very amazing results on facial images.\nIn addition to improving the resolution size of GANs, another interesting architecture \nthat increases the quality of outputs is the CycleGAN [92] proposed by Zhu et al. CycleGAN introduces an additional Cycle-Consistency loss function to help stabilize GAN \ntraining. This is applied to image-to-image translation. Neural Style Transfer [32], discussed further in the section below, learns a single image to single image translation. \nHowever, CycleGAN learns to translate from a domain of images to another domain, \nsuch as horses to zebras. This is implemented via forward and backward consistency loss \nfunctions. A generator takes in images of horses and learns to map them to zebras such \nthat the discriminator cannot tell if they were originally a part of the zebra set or not, as \ndiscussed above. After this, the generated zebras from horse images are passed through \na network which translates them back into horses. A second discriminator determines \nif this re-translated image belongs to the horse set or not. Both of these discriminator \nlosses are aggregated to form the cycle-consistency loss.\nThe use of CycleGANs was tested by Zhu et al. [93] in the task of Emotion Classification. Using the emotion recognition dataset, FER2013 [94], Facial Expression \nRecognition Database, they build a CNN classifier to recognize 7 different emotions: \nangry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. These classes are imbalanced \nand the CycleGAN is used as a method of intelligent oversampling.\nCycleGANs learned an unpaired image-to-image translation between domains. An \nexample of the domains in this problem is neutral to disgust. The CycleGAN learns to \ntranslate an image representing a neutral image into an image representing the disgust emotion (Figs. 19, 20).\nFig. 18 Complete DCGAN architecture used by Frid-Adar et al.

Employing these techniquess, accuracy improved 5-10%. To further \nunderstand the effectiveness of adding GAN-generated instances, a t-SNE visualization is used. t-SNE [87] is a visualization technique that learns to map between highdimensional vectors into a low-dimensional space to facilitate the visualization of \ndecision boundaries (Fig. 21).\nAnother interesting GAN architecture for use in Data Augmentation is Conditional \nGANs [95]. Conditional GANs add a conditional vector to both the generator and the \ndiscriminator in order to alleviate problems with mode collapse. In addition to inputting \na random vector z to the generator, Conditional GANs also input a y vector which could \nbe something like a one-hot encoded class label, e.g. [0 0 0 1 0]. This class label targets a \nspecific class for the generator and the discriminator (Fig. 22).\nFig. 19 Some examples of synthetic data created with CycleGANs for emotion classification\nFig. 20 Architecture overview: G and F consist of two separate GANs composing the CycleGAN.

[97] show how GAN samples can be used for unsupervised anomaly detection. By oversampling rare normal samples, which are samples that occur with \nsmall probability, GANs are able to reduce the false positive rate of anomaly detection. \nThey do this using the Adversarial Autoencoder framework proposed by Makhzani et al. \n[98] (Fig. 24).\nAs exciting as the potential of GANs is, it is very difficult to get high-resolution outputs from the current cutting-edge architectures. Increasing the output size of the \nimages produced by the generator will likely cause training instability and non-convergence. Another drawback of GANs is that they require a substantial amount of data to \ntrain. Thus, depending on how limited the initial dataset is, GANs may not be a practical \nsolution. Salimans et al. [99] provide a more complete description of the problems with \ntraining GANs.\nNeural Style Transfer\nNeural Style Transfer [32] is one of the flashiest demonstrations of Deep Learning \ncapabilities. The general idea is to manipulate the representations of images created in \nCNNs. Neural Style Transfer is probably best known for its artistic applications, but it \nalso serves as a great tool for Data Augmentation. The algorithm works by manipulating the sequential representations across a CNN such that the style of one image can be \ntransferred to another while preserving its original content. A more detailed explanation \nof the gram matrix operation powering Neural Style Transfer can be found by Li et al. \n[100] (Fig. 25).\nIt is important to also recognize an advancement of the original algorithm from Gatys \net al. known as Fast Style Transfer [35]. This algorithm extends the loss function from \na per-pixel loss to a perceptual loss and uses a feed-forward network to stylize images. \nThis perceptual loss is reasoned about through the use of another pre-trained net. The \nuse of perceptual loss over per-pixel loss has also shown great promise in the application of super-resolution [101] as well as style transfer. This loss function enhancement \nenables style transfer to run much faster, increasing interest in practical applications. \nAdditionally, Ulyanov et al. [102] find that replacing batch normalization with instance \nnormalization results in a significant improvement for fast stylization (Fig. 26).\nFor the purpose of Data Augmentation, this is somewhat analogous to color space \nlighting transformations. Neural Style Transfer extends lighting variations and enables \nthe encoding of different texture and artistic styles as well. This leaves practitioners of \nData Augmentation with the decision of which styles to sample from when deriving new \nimages via Neural Style Transfer.\nChoosing which styles to sample from can be a challenging task. For applications such as self-driving cars it is fairly intuitive to think of transferring training \nFig. 24 Adversarial autoencoder framework used in DOPING [97]",

However, \nin other application domains, the set of styles to transfer into is not so obvious. For \nease of implementation, data augmentation via Neural Style Transfer could be done \nby selecting a set of k styles and applying them to all images in the training set. The \nwork of Style Augmentation [103], avoids introducing a new form of style bias into \nthe dataset by deriving styles at random from a distribution of 79,433 artistic images. \nTransferring style in training data has been tested on the transition from simulated \nenvironments to the real-world. This is very useful for robotic manipulation tasks \nusing Reinforcement Learning because of potential damages to hardware when training in the real-world. Many constraints such as low-fidelity cameras cause these \nmodels to generalize poorly when trained in physics simulations and deployed in the \nreal-world.\nTobin et al.

They found that with enough variability in the training \ndata style, the real-world simply appears as another variation to the model. Interestingly, \nthey found that diversity in styles was more effective than simulating in as realistic of an \nenvironment as possible. This is in contrast to the work of Shrivastava et al. [105] who \nused GANs to make their simulated data as realistic as possible (Fig. 27).\nUsing simulated data to build Computer Vision models has been heavily investigated. \nOne example of this is from Richter et al.

The authors highlight anecdotes of the manual annotation costs required to \nbuild these pixel-level datasets. They mention the CamVid dataset [107] requires 60 min \nper image to manually annotate, and the Cityscapes dataset [108] requires 90 min per \nimage. This high labor and time cost motivates the use and development of synthetic \ndatasets. Neural Style Transfer is a very interesting strategy to improve the generalization ability of simulated datasets.\nA disadvantage of Neural Style Transfer Data Augmentation is the effort required to \nselect styles to transfer images into. If the style set is too small, further biases could be \nintroduced into the dataset. Trying to replicate the experiments of Tobin et al.

Utilizing evolutionary and random search algorithms is an interesting area of future \nwork, but the meta-learning schemes reviewed in this survey are all neural-network, \ngradient-based.\nThe history of Deep Learning advancement from feature engineering such as SIFT \n[113] and HOG [114] to architecture design such as AlexNet [1], VGGNet [2], and \nInception-V3 [4], suggest that meta-architecture design is the next paradigm shift. \nNAS takes a novel approach to meta-learning architectures by using a recurrent network trained with Reinforcement Learning to design architectures that result in the \nbest accuracy. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, this achieved an error rate of 3.65 (Fig. 28).\nThis section will introduce three experiments using meta-learning for Data Augmentation. These methods use a prepended neural network to learn Data Augmentations via mixing images, Neural Style Transfer, and geometric transformations.\nNeural augmentation The Neural Style Transfer algorithm requires two parameters \nfor the weights of the style and content loss. Perez and Wang [36] presented an algorithm to meta-learn a Neural Style Transfer strategy called Neural Augmentation. The \nNeural Augmentation approach takes in two random images from the same class. The \nprepended augmentation net maps them into a new image through a CNN with 5 \nlayers, each with 16 channels, 3 × 3 filters, and ReLU activation functions. The image \noutputted from the augmentation is then transformed with another random image via \nNeural Style Transfer. This style transfer is carried out via the CycleGAN [92] extension of the GAN [31] framework. These images are then fed into a classification model \nand the error from the classification model is backpropagated to update the Neural \nAugmentation net. The Neural Augmentation network uses this error to learn the optimal weighting for content and style images between different images as well as the \nmapping between images in the CNN (Fig. 29).\nPerez and Wang tested their algorithm on the MNIST and Tiny-imagenet-200 datasets on binary classification tasks such as cat versus dog. The Tiny-imagenet-200 \ndataset is used to simulate limited data. The Tiny-imagenet-200 dataset contains \nonly 500 images in each of the classes, with 100 set aside for validation.

Each of \nthe Tiny-imagenet-200 images is 64 × 64 × 3, and the MNIST images are 28 × 28 × 1. \nThe experiment compares their proposed Neural Augmentation [36] approach with \ntraditional augmentation techniques such as cropping and rotation, as well as with \na style transfer approach with a predetermined set of styles such as Night/Day and \nWinter/Summer.\nThe traditional baseline study transformed images by choosing an augmentation \nfrom a set (shifted, zoomed in/out, rotated, flipped, distorted, or shaded with a hue). \nThis was repeated to increase the dataset size from N to 2 N. The GAN style transfer \nbaseline uses 6 different styles to transform images (Cezanne, Enhance, Monet, Ukiyoe, Van Gogh and Winter). The Neural Augmentation techniques tested consist of \nthree levels based on the design of the loss function for the augmentation net (Content loss, Style loss via gram matrix, and no loss computer at this layer). All experiments are tested with a convolutional network consisting of 3 convolutional layers \neach followed by max pooling and batch normalization, followed by 2 fully-connected \nlayers. Each experiment runs for 40 epochs at a learning rate of 0.0001 with the Adam \noptimization technique (Table 7).\nThe results of the experiment are very promising. The Neural Augmentation technique performs significantly better on the Dogs versus Goldfish study and only \nslightly worse on Dogs versus Cats. The technique does not have any impact on the \nMNIST problem. The paper suggests that the likely best strategy would be to combine \nthe traditional augmentations and the Neural Augmentations.\nSmart Augmentation The Smart Augmentation [37] approach utilizes a similar concept as the Neural Augmentation technique presented above. However, the combination of images is derived exclusively from the learned parameters of a prepended CNN, \nrather than using the Neural Style Transfer algorithm.\nSmart Augmentation is another approach to meta-learning augmentations. This is \ndone by having two networks, Network-A and Network-B. Network-A is an augmentation network that takes in two or more input images and maps them into a new \nimage or images to train Network-B.

The \nconceptual framework of Network-A can be expanded to use several Networks trained \nin parallel. Multiple Network-As could be very useful for learning class-specific augmentations via meta-learning (Fig. 30).\nSmart Augmentation is similar to SamplePairing [65] or mixed-examples in the sense \nthat a combination of existing examples produces new ones. However, the mechanism of \nSmart Augmentation is much more sophisticated, using an adaptive CNN to derive new \nimages rather than averaging pixels or hand-engineered image combinations.\nThe Smart Augmentation technique was tested on the task of gender recognition. \nOn the Feret dataset, accuracy improved from 83.52 to 88.46%. The audience dataset \nresponded with an improvement of 70.02% to 76.06%. Most interestingly, results from \nanother face dataset increased from 88.15 to 95.66%. This was compared with traditional \naugmentation techniques which increased the accuracy from 88.15 to 89.08%. Additionally, this experiment derived the same accuracy when using two Network-As in the augmentation framework as was found with one Network-A.

AutoAugment is a Reinforcement Learning algorithm [115] that searches for an optimal \naugmentation policy amongst a constrained set of geometric transformations with miscellaneous levels of distortions. For example, ‘translateX 20 pixels’ could be one of the \ntransformations in the search space (Table 8).\nIn Reinforcement Learning algorithms, a policy is analogous to the strategy of the \nlearning algorithm. This policy determines what actions to take at given states to achieve \nsome goal. The AutoAugment approach learns a policy which consists of many subpolicies, each sub-policy consisting of an image transformation and a magnitude of \ntransformation. Reinforcement Learning is thus used as a discrete search algorithm of \naugmentations. The authors also suggest that evolutionary algorithms or random search \nwould be effective search algorithms as well.\nAutoAugment found policies which achieved a 1.48% error rate on CIFAR-10. AutoAugment also achieved an 83.54% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. Very interestingly as well, the policies learned on the ImageNet dataset were successful when \ntransferred to the Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft image recognition tasks. In this \ncase, the ImageNet policy applied to these other datasets reduced error rates by 1.16% \nand 1.76% respectively.\nGeng et al. [116] expanded on AutoAugment by replacing the Reinforcement Learning \nsearch algorithm with Augmented Random Search (ARS) [112]. The authors point out \nthat the sub-policies learned from AutoAugment are inherently flawed because of the \ndiscrete search space. They convert the probability and magnitude of augmentations into \na continuous space and search for sub-policies with ARS. With this, they achieve lower \nerror rates on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet (Table 9).\nMinh et  al. [117] also experimented with using Reinforcement Learning [115] to \nsearch for Data Augmentations. They further explore the effectiveness of learning transformations for individual instances rather than the entire dataset. They find classification accuracy differences of 70.18% versus 74.42% on the CIFAR-10 dataset and 74.61% \nversus 80.35% on the problem of classifying dogs versus cats. Further, they explore the \nrobustness of classifiers with respect to test-time augmentation and find that the model \nFig. 31 On the gender recognition task, the image to the left is an example of an instance produced by \nNetwork-A in Smart Augmentation given the right images as input [37]",

Additionally, meta-learning schemes can be difficult and time-consuming \nto implement. Practitioners of meta-learning will have to solve problems primarily with \nvanishing gradients [118], amongst others, to train these networks.\nTable 8 AutoAugment augmentation policy found on the reduced CIFAR-10 dataset [38]\nOperation 1\nOperation 2\nSub-policy 0\n(Invert,0.1,7)\n(Contrast,0.2,6)\nSub-policy 1\n(Rotate,0.7,2)\n(TranslateX,0.3,9)\nSub-policy 2\n(Sharpness,0.8,1)\n(Sharpness,0.9,3)\nSub-policy 3\n(ShearY,0.5,8)\n(TranslateY,0.7,9)\nSub-policy 4\n(AutoContrast,0.5,8)\n(Equalize,0.9,2)\nSub-policy 5\n(ShearY,0.2,7)\n(Posterize,0.3,7)\nSub-policy 6\n(Color,0.4,3)\n(Brightness,0.6,7)\nSub-policy 7\n(Sharpness,0.3,9)\n(Brightness,0.7,9)\nSub-policy 8\n(Equalize,0.6,5)\n(Equalize,0.5,1)\nSub-policy 9\n(Contrast,0.6,7)\n(Sharpness,0.6,5)\nSub-policy 10\n(Color,0.7,7)\n(TranslateX,0.5,8)\nSub-policy 11\n(Equalize,0.3,7)\n(AutoContrast,0.4,8)\nSub-policy 12\n(TranslateY,0.4,3)\n(Sharpness,0.2,6)\nSub-policy 13\n(Brightness,0.9,6)\n(Color,0.2,8)\nSub-policy 14\n(Solarize,0.5,2)\n(Invert,0.0,3)\nSub-policy 15\n(Equalize,0.2,0)\n(AutoContrast,0.6,0)\nSub-policy 16\n(Equalize,0.2,8)\n(Equalize,0.6,4)\nSub-policy 17\n(Color,0.9,9)\n(Equalize,0.6,6)\nSub-policy 18\n(AutoContrast,0.8,4)\n(Solarize,0.2,8)\nSub-policy 19\n(Brightness,0.1,3)\n(Color,0.7,0)\nSub-policy 20\n(Solarize,0.4,5)\n(AutoContrast,0.9,3)\nSub-policy 21\n(TranslateY,0.9,9)\n(TranslateY,0.7,9)\nSub-policy 22\n(AutoContrast,0.9,2)\n(Solarize,0.8,3)\nSub-policy 23\n(Equalize,0.8,8)\n(Invert,0.1,3)\nSub-policy 24\n(TranslateY,0.7,9)\n(AutoContrast,0.9,1)\nTable 9 The performance of ARS on continuous space vs. AutoAugment on discrete space \n[116]\nModel\nAutoAugment\nARS-Aug\nWide-ResNet-28-10\n2.68\n2.33\nShake-Shake (26 2 × 32 days)\n2.47\n2.14\nShake-Shake (26 2 × 96 days)\n1.99\n1.68\nShake-Shake (26 2 × 112 days)\n1.89\n1.59\nAmoebaNet-B (6,128)\n1.75\n1.49\nPyramidNet + ShakeDrop\n1.48\n1.26",

However, there are not many comparative studies \nthat show the performance differences of these different augmentations. One such study \nwas conducted by Shijie et al. [119] which compared GANs, WGANs, flipping, cropping, \nshifting, PCA jittering, color jittering, adding noise, rotation, and some combinations on \nthe CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Additionally, the comparative study ranged across \ndataset sizes with the small set consisting of 2 k samples with 200 in each class, tthe \nmedium set consisting of 10 k samples with 1 k in each class, and the large set consisting of 50 k samples with 5 k in each class. They also tested with 3 levels of augmentation, \nno augmentation, original plus same size of generated samples, and original plus double \nsize of generated samples. They found that cropping, flipping, WGAN, and rotation generally performed better than others. The combinations of flipping + cropping and flipping + WGAN were the best overall, improving classification performance on CIFAR-10 \nby + 3% and + 3.5%, respectively.\nDesign considerations for image Data Augmentation\nThis section will briefly describe some additional design decisions with respect to Data \nAugmentation techniques on image data.\nTest-time augmentation\nIn addition to augmenting training data, many research reports have shown the effectiveness of augmenting data at test-time as well. This can be seen as analogous to ensemble learning techniques in the data space. By taking a test image and augmenting it in the \nsame way as the training images, a more robust prediction can be derived. This comes \nat a computational cost depending on the augmentations performed, and it can restrict \nthe speed of the model. This could be a very costly bottleneck in models that require \nreal-time prediction. However, test-time augmentation is a promising practice for applications such as medical image diagnosis. Radosavovic et al. [120] denote test-time augmentation as data distillation to describe the use of ensembled predictions to get a better \nrepresentation of the image.\nWang et al. [121] sought out to develop a mathematical framework to formulate testtime augmentation. Testing their test-time augmentation scheme on medical image \nsegmentation, they found that it outperformed the single-prediction baseline and dropout-based multiple predictions. They also found better uncertainty estimation when \nusing test-time augmentation, reducing highly confident but incorrect predictions. \nTheir test-time augmentation method uses a Monte Carlo simulation in order to obtain \nparameters for different augmentations such as flipping, scaling, rotation, and translations, as well as noise injections.\nTest-time augmentation can be found in the Alexnet paper [1], which applies CNNs \nto the ImageNet dataset. In their experiments, they average the predictions on ten randomly cropped patches. These patches consist of one extracted from the center, four \ncorner croppings, and the equivalent regions on the horizontally flipped images. These \npredictions are averaged to form the final output. He et al. [3] use the same 10-crop testing procedure to evaluate their ResNet CNN architecture (Fig. 32).",

These augmentations tested include color augmentation, rotation, shearing, scaling, flipping, random cropping, random erasing, elastic, \nmixing, and combinations between the techniques. Table  9 shows the higher performance achieved when augmenting test images as well as training images. Matsunaga \net al. [123] also demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time augmentation on skin lesion \nclassification, using geometric transformations such as rotation, translation, scaling, and \nflipping.\nThe impact of test-time augmentation on classification accuracy is another mechanism \nfor measuring the robustness of a classifier. A robust classifier is thus defined as having a \nlow variance in predictions across augmentations. For example, a prediction of an image \nshould not be much different when that same image is rotated 20°. In their experiments \nsearching for augmentations with Reinforcement Learning, Minh et al. [117] measure \nrobustness by distorting test images with a 50% probability and contrasting the accuracy on un-augmented data with the augmented data. In this study, the performance of \nthe baseline model decreases from 74.61 to 66.87% when evaluated on augmented test \nimages.\nSome classification models lie on the fence in terms of their necessity for speed. This \nsuggests promise in developing methods that incrementally upgrade the confidence \nof prediction. This could be done by first outputting a prediction with little or no testtime augmentation and then incrementally adding test-time augmentations to increase \nthe confidence of the prediction. Different Computer Vision tasks require certain constraints on the test-time augmentations that can be used. For example, image recognition can easily aggregate predictions across warped images. However, it is difficult to \naggregate predictions on geometrically transformed images in object detection and \nsemantic segmentation.\nCurriculum learning\nAside from the study of Data Augmentation, many researchers have been interested \nin trying to find a strategy for selecting training data that beats random selection. In \nthe context of Data Augmentation, research has been published investigating the relationship between original and augmented data across training epochs. Some research \nFig. 32 Impact of test-time data augmentation for skin lesion classification [122]",

Once the SamplePairing images are added to the training set, they run in cycles \nbetween 8:2 epochs, 8 with SamplePairing images, 2 without. Jaderberg et al. [124] train \nexclusively with synthetic data for natural scene text recognition. The synthetic data \nproduced the training data by enumerating through different fonts and augmentations. \nThis produced sets of training images for size 50 k and 90 k lexicons. Mikolajczyk and \nGrochowski [72] draw comparisons from transfer learning. They suggest that training on \naugmented data to learn the initial weights of a deep convolutional network is similar to \ntransferring weights trained on other datasets such as ImageNet. These weights are then \nfine-tuned only with the original training data.\nCurriculum learning decisions are especially important for One-Shot Learning systems such as FaceNet, presented by Schroff et  al. [125]. It is important to find faces \nwhich are somewhat similar to the new face such that the learned distance function is \nactually useful. In this sense, the concept of curriculum learning shares many similarities \nwith adversarial search algorithms or learning only on hard examples.\nCurriculum learning, a term originally coined by Bengio et al. [126], is an applicable \nconcept for all Deep Learning models, not just those constrained with limited data. Plotting out training accuracy over time across different initial training subsets could help \nreveal patterns in the data that dramatically speed up training time. Data Augmentation \nconstructs massively inflated training from combinations such as flipping, translating, \nand randomly erasing. It is highly likely that a subset exists in this set such that training \nwill be faster and more accurate.\nResolution impact\nAnother interesting discussion about Data Augmentation in images is the impact of resolution. Higher resolution images such as HD (1920 × 1080 × 3) or 4 K (3840 × 2160 × 3) \nrequire much more processing and memory to train deep CNNs. However, it seems \nintuitive that next-generation models would be trained on higher resolution images. \nMany current models downsample images from their original resolution to make the \nclassification problem computationally more feasible. However, sometimes this downsampling causes information loss within the image, making image recognition more difficult (Table 10).\nIt is interesting to investigate the nature of this downsampling and resulting performance comparison. Wu et al. [127] compare the tradeoff between accuracy and speed \nTable 10 Comparison of resolution across three very popular open-source image datasets\nDataset\nResolution\nMNIST handwritten digits\n28 × 28 × 1\nCIFAR-10/100\n32 × 32 × 3\nImageNet\n256 × 256 × 3",

The researchers found that composing an ensemble of models trained with high and low-resolution images performed \nbetter than any one model individually. This ensemble prediction is found by averaging the softmax predictions. The models trained on 256 × 256 images and 512 × 512 \nimages achieve 7.96% and 7.42% top-5 error rates, respectively. When aggregated they \nachieved a lower top-5 error rate of 6.97%. Therefore, different downsampled images can \nbe viewed as another Data Augmentation scheme (Fig. 33).\nWith the advance of Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks presented by \nChong et  al. [128] or SRGANs, Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks, \npresented by Ledig et al. [129], it is interesting to consider if upsampling images to an \neven higher resolution would result in better models. Quality upsampling on CIFAR-10 \nimages from even 32 × 32 × 3 to 64 × 64 × 3 could lead to better and more robust image \nclassifiers.\nResolution is also a very important topic with GANs. Producing high resolution outputs from GANs is very difficult due to issues with training stability and mode collapse. \nMany of the newer GAN architectures such as StackGAN [130] and Progressively-Growing GANs [34] are designed to produce higher resolution images. In addition to these \narchitectures, the use of super-resolution networks such as SRGAN could be an effective \ntechnique for improving the quality of outputs from a DCGAN [91] model. Once it is \npractical to produce high resolution outputs from GAN samples, these outputs will be \nvery useful for Data Augmentation.\nFinal dataset size\nA necessary component of Data Augmentation is the determination of the final dataset size. For example, if all images are horizontally flipped and added to the dataset, \nthe resulting dataset size changes from N to 2N. One of the main considerations with \nrespect to final dataset size is the additional memory and compute constraints associated with augmenting data. Practitioners have the choice between using generators \nwhich transform data on the fly during training or transforming the data beforehand and \nFig. 33 Classifications of the Image to the right by different resolution models trained by Wu et al.

Storing datasets in memory can be extremely problematic depending on \nhow heavily the dataset size has been inflated. Storing augmented datasets in memory is \nespecially problematic when augmenting big data. This decision is generally categorized \nas online or offline data augmentation, (with online augmentation referring to on the \nfly augmentations and offline augmentation referring to editing and storing data on the \ndisk).\nIn the design of a massively distributed training system, Chilimbi et al. [131] augment \nimages before training to speed up image serving. By augmenting images in advance, the \ndistributed system is able to request and pre-cache training batches. Augmentations can \nalso be built into the computational graph used to construct Deep Learning models and \nfacilitate fast differentiation. These augmentations process images immediately after the \ninput image tensor.\nAdditionally, it is also interesting to explore a subset of the inflated data that will result \nin higher or similar performance to the entire training set. This is a similar concept to \ncurriculum learning, since the central idea is to find an optimal ordering of training data. \nThis idea is also very related to final dataset size and the considerations of transformation compute and available memory for storing augmented images.\nAlleviating class imbalance with Data Augmentation\nClass imbalance is a common problem in which a dataset is primarily composed of \nexamples from one class. This could manifest itself in a binary classification problem \nsuch that there is a clear majority-minority class distinction, or in multi-class classification in which there is one or multiple majority classes and one or multiple minority \nclasses. Imbalanced datasets are harmful because they bias models towards majority \nclass predictions. Imbalanced datasets also render accuracy as a deceitful performance \nmetric. Buda et al. [132] provide a systematic study specifically investigating the impact \nof imbalanced data in CNNs processing image data. Leevy et al. [27] cover many Datalevel and Algorithm-level solutions to class imbalance in big data in general. Data \nAugmentation falls under a Data-level solution to class imbalance and there are many \ndifferent strategies for implementation.\nA naive solution to oversampling with Data Augmentation would be a simple random \noversampling with small geometric transformations such as a 30° rotation. Other simple image manipulations such as color augmentations, mixing images, kernel filters, and \nrandom erasing can also be extended to oversample data in the same manner as geometric augmentations. This can be useful for ease of implementation and quick experimentation with different class ratios. One problem of oversampling with basic image \ntransformations is that it could cause overfitting on the minority class which is being \noversampled. The biases present in the minority class are more prevalent post-sampling \nwith these techniques.\nOversampling methods based on Deep Learning such as adversarial training, Neural Style Transfer, GANs, and meta-learning schemes can also be used as a more intelligent oversampling strategy. Neural Style Transfer is an interesting way to create new \nimages. These new images can be created either through extrapolating style with a foreign style or by interpolating styles amongst instances within the dataset. Using GANs",

Oversampling with GANs can be done using \nthe entire minority class as “real” examples, or by using subsets of the minority class as \ninputs to GANs. The use of evolutionary sampling [133] to find these subsets to input to \nGANs for class sampling is a promising area for future work.\nDiscussion\nThe interesting ways to augment image data fall into two general categories: data warping and oversampling. Many of these augmentations elucidate how an image classifier \ncan be improved, while others do not. It is easy to explain the benefit of horizontal flipping or random cropping. However, it is not clear why mixing pixels or entire images \ntogether such as in PatchShuffle regularization or SamplePairing is so effective. Additionally, it is difficult to interpret the representations learned by neural networks for \nGAN-based augmentation, variational auto-encoders, and meta-learning. CNN visualization has been led by Yosinski et al. [134] with their deep visualization method. Having a human-level understanding of convolutional networks features could greatly help \nguide the augmentation process.\nManipulating the representation power of neural networks is being used in many \ninteresting ways to further the advancement of augmentation techniques. Traditional \nhand-crafted augmentation techniques such as cropping, flipping, and altering the color \nspace are being extended with the use of GANs, Neural Style Transfer, and meta-learning search algorithms.\nImage-to-image translation has many potential uses in Data Augmentation. Neural \nStyle Transfer uses neural layers to translate images into new styles. This technique not \nonly utilizes neural representations to separate ‘style’ and ‘content’ from images, but also \nuses neural transformations to transfer the style of one image into another. Neural Style \nTransfer is a much more powerful augmentation technique than traditional color space \naugmentations, but even these methods can be combined together.\nAn interesting characteristic of these augmentation methods is their ability to be combined together. For example, the random erasing technique can be stacked on top of any \nof these augmentation methods. The GAN framework possesses an intrinsic property \nof recursion which is very interesting. Samples taken from GANs can be augmented \nwith traditional augmentations such as lighting filters, or even used in neural network \naugmentation strategies such as Smart Augmentation or Neural Augmentation to create even more samples. These samples can be fed into further GANs and dramatically \nincrease the size of the original dataset. The extensibility of the GAN framework is \namongst many reasons they are so interesting to Deep Learning researchers.\nTest-time augmentation is analogous to ensemble learning in the data space. Instead \nof aggregating the predictions of different learning algorithms, we aggregate predictions \nacross augmented images. We can even extend the solution algorithm to parameterize \nprediction weights from different augmentations. This seems like a good solution for systems concerned with achieving very high performance scores, more so than prediction",

There is no consensus as to which ratio of original to final \ndataset size will result in the best performing model. However, imagine using color augmentations exclusively. If the initial training dataset consists of 50 dogs and 50 cats, and \neach image is augmented with 100 color filters to produce 5000 dogs and 5000 cats, this \ndataset will be heavily biased towards the spatial characteristics of the original 50 dogs \nand 50 cats. This over-extensive color-augmented data will cause a deep model to overfit \neven worse than the original. From this anecdote, we can conceptualize the existence of \nan optimal size for post-augmented data.\nAdditionally, there is no consensus about the best strategy for combining data warping \nand oversampling techniques. One important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the \ninitial, limited dataset. There are no existing augmentation techniques that can correct a \ndataset that has very poor diversity with respect to the testing data. All these augmentation algorithms perform best under the assumption that the training data and testing \ndata are both drawn from the same distribution. If this is not true, it is very unlikely that \nthese methods will be useful.\nFuture work\nFuture work in Data Augmentation will be focused on many different areas such as \nestablishing a taxonomy of augmentation techniques, improving the quality of GAN \nsamples, learning new ways to combine meta-learning and Data Augmentation, discovering relationships between Data Augmentation and classifier architecture, and extending these principles to other data types. We are interested in seeing how the time-series \ncomponent in video data impacts the use of static image augmentation techniques. Data \nAugmentation is not limited to the image domain and can be useful for text, bioinformatics, tabular records, and many more.\nOur future work intends to explore performance benchmarks across geometric and \ncolor space augmentations across several datasets from different image recognition \ntasks. These datasets will be constrained in size to test the effectiveness with respect to \nlimited data problems. Zhang et al. [135] test their novel GAN augmentation technique \non the SVHN dataset across 50, 80, 100, 200, and 500 training instances. Similar to this \nwork, we will look to further establish benchmarks for different levels of limited data.\nImproving the quality of GAN samples and testing their effectiveness on a wide range \nof datasets is another very important area for future work. We would like to further \nexplore the combinatorics of GAN samples with other augmentation techniques such as \napplying a range of style transfers to GAN-generated samples.\nSuper-resolution networks through the use of SRCNNs, Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks, and SRGANs are also very interesting areas for future work \nin Data Augmentation. We want to explore the performance differences across architectures with upsampled images such as expanding CIFAR-10 images from 32 × 32 to \n64 × 64 to 128 × 128 and so on. One of the primary difficulties with GAN samples is trying to achieve high-resolution outputs. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how we \ncan use super-resolution networks to achieve high-resolution such as DCGAN samples",

The result of this strategy will be compared with \nthe performance of the Progressively Growing GAN architecture.\nTest-time augmentation has the potential to make a massive difference in Computer \nVision performance and has not been heavily explored. We want to establish benchmarks for different ensembles of test-time augmentations and investigate the solution \nalgorithms used. Currently, majority voting seems to be the dominant solution algorithm for test-time augmentation. It seems highly likely that test-time augmentation \ncan be further improved if the weight of each augmented images prediction is further \nparameterized and learned. Additionally, we will explore the effectiveness of test-time \naugmentation on object detection, comparing color space augmentations and the Neural \nStyle Transfer algorithm.\nMeta-learning GAN architectures is another exciting area of interest. Using Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as NAS on the generator and discriminator architectures \nseem very promising. Another interesting area of further research is to use an evolutionary approach to speed up the training of GANs through parallelization and cluster \ncomputing.\nAnother important area of future work for practical integration of Data Augmentation \ninto Deep Learning workflows is the development of software tools. Similar to how the \nTensorflow [136] system automates the back-end processes of gradient-descent learning, Data Augmentation libraries will automate preprocessing functions. The Keras [137] \nlibrary provides an ImageDataGenerator class that greatly facilitates the implementation of geometric augmentations. Buslaev et  al. presented another augmentation tool \nthey called Albumentations [138]. The development of Neural Style Transfer, adversarial training, GANs, and meta-learning APIs will help engineers utilize the performance \npower of advanced Data Augmentation techniques much faster and more easily.\nConclusion\nThis survey presents a series of Data Augmentation solutions to the problem of overfitting in Deep Learning models due to limited data. Deep Learning models rely on big \ndata to avoid overfitting. Artificially inflating datasets using the methods discussed in \nthis survey achieves the benefit of big data in the limited data domain. Data Augmentation is a very useful technique for constructing better datasets. Many augmentations \nhave been proposed which can generally be classified as either a data warping or oversampling technique.\nThe future of Data Augmentation is very bright. The use of search algorithms combining data warping and oversampling methods has enormous potential. The layered \narchitecture of deep neural networks presents many opportunities for Data Augmentation. Most of the augmentations surveyed operate in the input layer. However, some \nare derived from hidden layer representations, and one method, DisturbLabel [28], is \neven manifested in the output layer. The space of intermediate representations and the \nlabel space are under-explored areas of Data Augmentation with interesting results. This \nsurvey focuses on applications for image data, although many of these techniques and \nconcepts can be expanded to other data domains.\nData Augmentation cannot overcome all biases present in a small dataset. For example, in a dog breed classification task, if there are only bulldogs and no instances of",

However, several forms of biases such as \nlighting, occlusion, scale, background, and many more are preventable or at least dramatically lessened with Data Augmentation. Overfitting is generally not as much of an \nissue with access to big data. Data Augmentation prevents overfitting by modifying limited datasets to possess the characteristics of big data.\nAbbreviations\nGAN: generative adversarial network; CNN: convolutional neural network; DCGAN: deep convolutional generative \nadversarial network; NAS: neural architecture search; SRCNN: super-resolution convolutional neural network; SRGAN: \nsuper-resolution generative adversarial network; CT: computerized tomography; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; \nPET: positron emission tomography; ROS: random oversampling; SMOTE: synthetic minority oversampling technique; \nRGB: red-green-blue; PCA: principal components analysis; UCI: University of California Irvine; MNIST: Modified National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology; CIFAR: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; t-SNE: t-distributed stochastic \nneighbor embedding.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the reviewers in the Data Mining and Machine Learning Laboratory at Florida Atlantic University. \nAdditionally, we acknowledge partial support by the NSF (CNS-1427536).

    "introduction": "Deep Learning models have made incredible progress in discriminative tasks. This has \nbeen fueled by the advancement of deep network architectures, powerful computation, \nand access to big data. Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to Computer Vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation thanks to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These neural \nnetworks utilize parameterized, sparsely connected kernels which preserve the spatial \ncharacteristics of images. Convolutional layers sequentially downsample the spatial \nresolution of images while expanding the depth of their feature maps. This series of \nconvolutional transformations can create much lower-dimensional and more useful representations of images than what could possibly be hand-crafted. The success of CNNs \nhas spiked interest and optimism in applying Deep Learning to Computer Vision tasks.",

    "discussion": "The interesting ways to augment image data fall into two general categories: data warping and oversampling. Many of these augmentations elucidate how an image classifier \ncan be improved, while others do not. It is easy to explain the benefit of horizontal flipping or random cropping. However, it is not clear why mixing pixels or entire images \ntogether such as in PatchShuffle regularization or SamplePairing is so effective. Additionally, it is difficult to interpret the representations learned by neural networks for \nGAN-based augmentation, variational auto-encoders, and meta-learning. CNN visualization has been led by Yosinski et al. [134] with their deep visualization method. Having a human-level understanding of convolutional networks features could greatly help \nguide the augmentation process.\nManipulating the representation power of neural networks is being used in many \ninteresting ways to further the advancement of augmentation techniques. Traditional \nhand-crafted augmentation techniques such as cropping, flipping, and altering the color \nspace are being extended with the use of GANs, Neural Style Transfer, and meta-learning search algorithms.\nImage-to-image translation has many potential uses in Data Augmentation. Neural \nStyle Transfer uses neural layers to translate images into new styles. This technique not \nonly utilizes neural representations to separate ‘style’ and ‘content’ from images, but also \nuses neural transformations to transfer the style of one image into another. Neural Style \nTransfer is a much more powerful augmentation technique than traditional color space \naugmentations, but even these methods can be combined together.\nAn interesting characteristic of these augmentation methods is their ability to be combined together. For example, the random erasing technique can be stacked on top of any \nof these augmentation methods. The GAN framework possesses an intrinsic property \nof recursion which is very interesting. Samples taken from GANs can be augmented \nwith traditional augmentations such as lighting filters, or even used in neural network \naugmentation strategies such as Smart Augmentation or Neural Augmentation to create even more samples. These samples can be fed into further GANs and dramatically \nincrease the size of the original dataset. The extensibility of the GAN framework is \namongst many reasons they are so interesting to Deep Learning researchers.\nTest-time augmentation is analogous to ensemble learning in the data space. Instead \nof aggregating the predictions of different learning algorithms, we aggregate predictions \nacross augmented images. We can even extend the solution algorithm to parameterize \nprediction weights from different augmentations. This seems like a good solution for systems concerned with achieving very high performance scores, more so than prediction\n\nPage 42 of 48\nShorten and Khoshgoftaar J Big Data (2019) 6:60 \nspeed. Determining the effectiveness of test-time augmentation by primarily exploring \ntest-time geometric transformations and Neural Style Transfer, is an area of future work.\nAn interesting question for practical Data Augmentation is how to determine postaugmented dataset size. There is no consensus as to which ratio of original to final \ndataset size will result in the best performing model. However, imagine using color augmentations exclusively. If the initial training dataset consists of 50 dogs and 50 cats, and \neach image is augmented with 100 color filters to produce 5000 dogs and 5000 cats, this \ndataset will be heavily biased towards the spatial characteristics of the original 50 dogs \nand 50 cats. This over-extensive color-augmented data will cause a deep model to overfit \neven worse than the original. From this anecdote, we can conceptualize the existence of \nan optimal size for post-augmented data.\nAdditionally, there is no consensus about the best strategy for combining data warping \nand oversampling techniques. One important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the \ninitial, limited dataset. There are no existing augmentation techniques that can correct a \ndataset that has very poor diversity with respect to the testing data. All these augmentation algorithms perform best under the assumption that the training data and testing \ndata are both drawn from the same distribution. If this is not true, it is very unlikely that \nthese methods will be useful.\nFuture work\nFuture work in Data Augmentation will be focused on many different areas such as \nestablishing a taxonomy of augmentation techniques, improving the quality of GAN \nsamples, learning new ways to combine meta-learning and Data Augmentation, discovering relationships between Data Augmentation and classifier architecture, and extending these principles to other data types. We are interested in seeing how the time-series \ncomponent in video data impacts the use of static image augmentation techniques. Data \nAugmentation is not limited to the image domain and can be useful for text, bioinformatics, tabular records, and many more.\nOur future work intends to explore performance benchmarks across geometric and \ncolor space augmentations across several datasets from different image recognition \ntasks. These datasets will be constrained in size to test the effectiveness with respect to \nlimited data problems. Zhang et al. [135] test their novel GAN augmentation technique \non the SVHN dataset across 50, 80, 100, 200, and 500 training instances. Similar to this \nwork, we will look to further establish benchmarks for different levels of limited data.\nImproving the quality of GAN samples and testing their effectiveness on a wide range \nof datasets is another very important area for future work. We would like to further \nexplore the combinatorics of GAN samples with other augmentation techniques such as \napplying a range of style transfers to GAN-generated samples.\nSuper-resolution networks through the use of SRCNNs, Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks, and SRGANs are also very interesting areas for future work \nin Data Augmentation. We want to explore the performance differences across architectures with upsampled images such as expanding CIFAR-10 images from 32 × 32 to \n64 × 64 to 128 × 128 and so on. One of the primary difficulties with GAN samples is trying to achieve high-resolution outputs. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how we \ncan use super-resolution networks to achieve high-resolution such as DCGAN samples\n\nPage 43 of 48\nShorten and Khoshgoftaar J Big Data (2019) 6:60 \ninputted into an SRCNN or SRGAN. The result of this strategy will be compared with \nthe performance of the Progressively Growing GAN architecture.\nTest-time augmentation has the potential to make a massive difference in Computer \nVision performance and has not been heavily explored. We want to establish benchmarks for different ensembles of test-time augmentations and investigate the solution \nalgorithms used. Currently, majority voting seems to be the dominant solution algorithm for test-time augmentation. It seems highly likely that test-time augmentation \ncan be further improved if the weight of each augmented images prediction is further \nparameterized and learned. Additionally, we will explore the effectiveness of test-time \naugmentation on object detection, comparing color space augmentations and the Neural \nStyle Transfer algorithm.\nMeta-learning GAN architectures is another exciting area of interest. Using Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as NAS on the generator and discriminator architectures \nseem very promising. Another interesting area of further research is to use an evolutionary approach to speed up the training of GANs through parallelization and cluster \ncomputing.\nAnother important area of future work for practical integration of Data Augmentation \ninto Deep Learning workflows is the development of software tools. Similar to how the \nTensorflow [136] system automates the back-end processes of gradient-descent learning, Data Augmentation libraries will automate preprocessing functions. The Keras [137] \nlibrary provides an ImageDataGenerator class that greatly facilitates the implementation of geometric augmentations. Buslaev et  al. presented another augmentation tool \nthey called Albumentations [138]. The development of Neural Style Transfer, adversarial training, GANs, and meta-learning APIs will help engineers utilize the performance \npower of advanced Data Augmentation techniques much faster and more easily.",
    "conclusion": "This survey presents a series of Data Augmentation solutions to the problem of overfitting in Deep Learning models due to limited data. Deep Learning models rely on big \ndata to avoid overfitting. Artificially inflating datasets using the methods discussed in \nthis survey achieves the benefit of big data in the limited data domain. Data Augmentation is a very useful technique for constructing better datasets. Many augmentations \nhave been proposed which can generally be classified as either a data warping or oversampling technique.\nThe future of Data Augmentation is very bright. The use of search algorithms combining data warping and oversampling methods has enormous potential. The layered \narchitecture of deep neural networks presents many opportunities for Data Augmentation. Most of the augmentations surveyed operate in the input layer. However, some \nare derived from hidden layer representations, and one method, DisturbLabel [28], is \neven manifested in the output layer. The space of intermediate representations and the \nlabel space are under-explored areas of Data Augmentation with interesting results. This \nsurvey focuses on applications for image data, although many of these techniques and \nconcepts can be expanded to other data domains.\nData Augmentation cannot overcome all biases present in a small dataset. For example, in a dog breed classification task, if there are only bulldogs and no instances of\n\nPage 44 of 48\nShorten and Khoshgoftaar J Big Data (2019) 6:60 \ngolden retrievers, no augmentation method discussed, from SamplePairing to AutoAugment to GANs, will create a golden retriever. However, several forms of biases such as \nlighting, occlusion, scale, background, and many more are preventable or at least dramatically lessened with Data Augmentation. Overfitting is generally not as much of an \nissue with access to big data. Data Augmentation prevents overfitting by modifying limited datasets to possess the characteristics of big data.\nAbbreviations\nGAN: generative adversarial network; CNN: convolutional neural network; DCGAN: deep convolutional generative \nadversarial network; NAS: neural architecture search; SRCNN: super-resolution convolutional neural network; SRGAN: \nsuper-resolution generative adversarial network; CT: computerized tomography; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; \nPET: positron emission tomography; ROS: random oversampling; SMOTE: synthetic minority oversampling technique; \nRGB: red-green-blue; PCA: principal components analysis; UCI: University of California Irvine; MNIST: Modified National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology; CIFAR: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; t-SNE: t-distributed stochastic \nneighbor embedding.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the reviewers in the Data Mining and Machine Learning Laboratory at Florida Atlantic University. \nAdditionally, we acknowledge partial support by the NSF (CNS-1427536).
