    "We show that\nour network can approximate any set function that is\ncontinuous.",
    "Under a uniﬁed architecture, not only is\nour PointNet much faster in speed, but it also exhibits strong\nperformance on par or even better than state of the art.",
    "The decay rate for batch normalization\nstarts with 0.5 and is gradually increased to 0.99.",
    "Shape Correspondence\nIn this section, we show that\npoint features learnt by PointNet can be potentially used\nto compute shape correspondences.",
    "We compare with vanilla\nversions of other deep architectures to show that our network based\non point sets input is achieving reasonable performance on this\ntraditional task."
