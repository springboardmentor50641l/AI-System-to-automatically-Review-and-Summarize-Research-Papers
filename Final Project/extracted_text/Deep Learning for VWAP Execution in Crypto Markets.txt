Abstract
Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is arguably the most prevalent bench-
mark for trade execution as it provides an unbiased standard for comparing perfor-
mance across market participants. However, achieving VWAP is inherently challeng-
ing due to its dependence on two dynamic factors—volumes and prices. Traditional
approaches typically focus on forecasting the market’s volume curve, an assumption
that may hold true under steady conditions but becomes suboptimal in more volatile
environments or markets such as cryptocurrency where prediction error margins are
higher. In this study, I propose a deep learning framework that directly optimizes the
VWAP execution objective by bypassing the intermediate step of volume curve pre-
diction. Leveraging automatic differentiation and custom loss functions, my method
calibrates order allocation to minimize VWAP slippage, thereby fully addressing
the complexities of the execution problem. My results demonstrate that this direct
optimization approach consistently achieves lower VWAP slippage compared to
conventional methods, even when utilizing a naive linear model presented in [ 9].They
validate the observation that strategies optimized for VWAP performance tend to
diverge from accurate volume curve predictions and thus underscore the advantage
of directly modeling the execution objective. This research contributes a more
efficient and robust framework for VWAP execution in volatile markets, illustrating
the potential of deep learning in complex financial systems where direct objective
optimization is crucial. Although my empirical analysis focuses on cryptocurrency
markets, the underlying principles of the framework are readily applicable to other
asset classes such as equities.
1arXiv:2502.13722v2  [q-fin.ST]  2 Apr 2025 1 Introduction
In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
strategies have become a cornerstone for executing high-volume trades, as they aim to
minimize market impact and reduce execution costs. VWAP is widely regarded for its
fair and neutral calibration, making it an industry standard for comparing performance
across market participants [ 1]. With the rise of systematic trading, execution strategies
have received increasing attention; more specifically, significant institutional trades are
now executed using algorithms [ 21]. Despite this, academic research has predominantly
focused on Implementation Shortfall (IS) [ 26] strategies, while VWAP, despite its extensive
industrial use and reputation as a robust benchmark (particularly for large orders) [ 22], has
not been as thoroughly explored. The objective of this study is to propose an alternative
VWAP execution approach that moves beyond methods relying solely on forecasting
the market volume curve. Indeed, while early approaches in the literature were able to
incorporate the price–volume relationship under simplified modeling assumptions, more
recent works tend to focus exclusively on the volume curve. This shift arises because more
realistic and higher-performing volume models render the simultaneous representation of
the volume–volatility (and hence price–volume) relationship considerably more complex.
The purpose of this paper is to introduce a method that easily overcomes this limitation,
thereby more accurately capturing the full VWAP decision problem. To achieve this, I
leverage deep learning as a generalized function calibrator. This approach allows the direct
representation of the execution objective in a single step—bypassing the conventional two-
step process of first predicting the volume curve and then allocating orders. Traditional
econometric and machine learning tools typically rely on this two-step resolution, which
can be suboptimal in the presence of prediction errors. The primary challenge in VWAP
execution is to optimally allocate trading volumes over the execution horizon—a problem
for which historical data does not offer a direct solution. Existing literature often simplifies
this challenge by assuming that matching the market’s volume curve is ideal. However,
this assumption overlooks the fact that perfect volume predictions are unattainable,
especially in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Recognizing and incorporating these
inevitable prediction errors into the allocation strategy is essential for achieving a price
closer to the market VWAP. Moreover, while conventional models can be calibrated to
forecast the volume curve from historical data, directly calibrating an execution strategy
is not straightforward because the optimal allocation is unknown in advance. Deep
learning offers a significant advantage here. Unlike frameworks that minimize the error
between predicted and observed data points, deep learning enables the implementation
and optimization of any loss function—thanks to automatic differentiation. The central
idea of this paper is to build a model that ingests market data, produces an allocation
curve for the order, and is trained to minimize the absolute or quadratic error between the
achieved execution price and the market VWAP. Finally, although some studies propose
dynamic approaches that update predictions throughout an order’s lifetime, I opt for a
static framework for two reasons. First, I aim to demonstrate that even a relatively simple
network—such as the naive linear model I use—can enhance performance when directly
2 representing the trading strategy. Second, incorporating real-time dynamics introduces
additional technological complexities that are beyond the scope of this study. My goal
is to propose a simple yet effective method for VWAP execution that fully captures the
decision problem and leverages deep learning’s flexibility to directly optimize the trader’s
true objective.
2 Related work
One of the earliest works on VWAP strategies is by [ 19], who proposed an optimal slicing
strategy for VWAP execution. In scenarios where volume and volatility are uncorrelated,
the optimal execution curve aligns with the relative market volume curve; deviations in the
correlated case were also quantified. Building on this, [ 23] extended Konishi’s model by
incorporating a constrained trading rate and an additional drift term—reflecting situations
where traders or brokers, armed with sensitive information, may attempt to “beat” the
VWAP. Their study also derived stylized facts regarding the expected relative volume
(normalized by trade count), observing an S-shaped pattern throughout the trading day for
equities, with higher-turnover stocks exhibiting less variability. These patterns echo the
well-known U-shaped trading activity in equity markets. Later, [ 24] advanced this work by
developing a continuously dynamic model, demonstrating that an optimal VWAP trading
strategy is closely linked to intraday volume estimation. Volumes have also been used
as covariates to explain other market variables such as price or volatility [ 6,28,27,17],
typically using lower-frequency data rather than intraday figures. Additionally, studies
such as [ 12] have focused on measuring overall market trading activity through volume
metrics.
In 2008, [ 2] proposed a method for estimating intraday volumes by decomposing them
into two components—an approach refined in [ 3] by separating volumes into a market
evolution component and a stock-specific pattern. The dynamic component was modeled
using ARMA and SETAR techniques, resulting in significantly improved accuracy over
static volume curve approaches. However, while earlier works like [ 19] and [23] attempted
to capture the interrelation between price and volume within relatively simple frameworks,
[2] and [3] focused exclusively on the volume component, as incorporating a realistic
volume–price relationship renders overall modeling significantly more complex. An
alternative execution method is presented in [ 14], where Dynamic VWAP (DVWAP) is
introduced in contrast to the conventional Historical VWAP (HVWAP). It is argued that
incoming news during execution can affect volumes in both directions—information that
HVWAP ignores. Their DVWAP framework, built upon earlier methodologies (e.g., those
of Bialkowski, Darolles, and Le Fol), not only leverages these improvements but further
enhances VWAP performance. Other approaches include stochastic methods proposed by
[4] and [7]. As noted by Frei and Westray, these models derive an optimal trading rate that
depends solely on volume curves, neglecting price dynamics due to the assumption that the
price process behaves as an uncorrelated Brownian motion. In [ 5], the focus shifts partially
to the strategic aspects of VWAP execution at high frequencies, addressing the dilemma
faced by brokers between using aggressive versus passive orders. Finally, [ 13] introduced
3 two novel contributions. First, they integrated both temporary and permanent market
impact components—an important consideration for large institutional orders aiming
to minimize market impact. Second, they proposed a method for pricing guaranteed
VWAP services using a CARA utility function for the broker and indifference pricing.
Unlike other approaches that solely strive for benchmark proximity, their framework
emphasizes achieving optimal execution while managing risk. A common theme among
these approaches is the predominant focus on modeling market volumes, often under
the assumption that prices and volumes are independent—a simplification that does
not fully capture market reality. Until recently, the latest advancements in machine
learning—particularly deep learning—had not been fully leveraged for VWAP execution.
Recent studies, however, have begun to explore these novel methods. For instance,
[20] proposed the Macro-Meta-Micro Trader (M3T) architecture, which combines deep
learning with hierarchical reinforcement learning to capture market patterns and execute
orders across multiple temporal scales. Although this approach achieved an average cost
saving of 1.16 basis points relative to an optimal baseline, its complexity may hinder
practical implementation. Similarly, [ 18] developed a dual-level reinforcement learning
strategy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to track daily cumulative VWAP.
Their method integrates a Transformer model to capture the overall U-shaped volume
pattern with an LSTM model for finer order distribution. Despite improved accuracy over
previous reinforcement learning models, it remains heavily reliant on volume prediction.
In [25], large stock order execution is simulated using LSTMs within the Almgren and
Chriss framework. By leveraging cross-sectional data from multiple stocks to capture
inter-stock dependencies, their approach consistently outperforms TWAP and VWAP-
based strategies on S&P100 data. However, the focus remains on minimizing transaction
costs rather than directly optimizing VWAP execution. While recent studies underscore
the potential of machine learning techniques for VWAP execution, many of these methods
continue to depend on traditional volume curve prediction rather than directly targeting
the VWAP execution objective.
3 Defining the VWAP Problem
TheVolume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark that reflects the
average price at which a security is traded throughout the day, weighted by volume. It
provides insights into both the trend and the value of a security.
•Its basic formulation is:
VWAP =Total Traded Value
Total Traded Volume. (1)
•More explicitly, VWAP is computed as:
VWAP =P
i(pi×vi)P
ivi, (2)
where pidenotes the price of the ith trade and vithe corresponding volume.
4 Defining the Execution Problem
The objective is to execute trades so that the average execution price aligns as closely
as possible with the market VWAP over a given period T. The total order volume is
denoted by vand the total market volume over the same period by V.
The average execution price is defined as:
P=Pn
j=1pj×vj
v,with v=nX
j=1vj, (3)
assuming that ntransactions are executed during period T.
Similarly, the market VWAP is defined as:
VWAP =PN
i=1pi×Vi
V,with V=NX
i=1Vi, (4)
where Nrepresents the total number of market transactions (including the order’s own
trades).
Addressing Slippage
Absolute slippage is defined as:
S=|P−VWAP |. (5)
Minimizing Sis challenging because the transaction space is non-standard—trades occur
as discrete events at irregular intervals rather than in uniform time or volume increments.
To simplify the analysis, the overall period is divided into Tsmaller intervals. Within
each interval, the following definitions apply:
VWAP T=PT
t=1VWAP t×Vt
V, P T=PT
t=1Pt×vt
v, (6)
where:
•Vtis the market volume in interval t,
•vtis the executed volume in interval t,
•VWAP tandPtdenote the market VWAP and the average execution price in interval
t, respectively.
This segmentation permits a more detailed comparison between PTand VWAP T.
5 Refining the Problem Definition
For further analysis, normalized volume proportions are introduced:
Qt=Vt
Vand qt=vt
v,
so that:
TX
t=1Qt=TX
t=1qt= 1.
Thus, the execution price and market VWAP can be rewritten as:
PT=TX
t=1Ptqtand VWAP T=TX
t=1VWAP tQt.
Accordingly, the slippage becomes:
ST=|PT−VWAP T|=TX
t=1(Ptqt−VWAP tQt). (7)
A common strategy to decompose the difference is to add and subtract a common term
inside the summation. In this case, VWAP tqtis added and subtracted for each interval:
Ptqt−VWAP tQt= (Ptqt−VWAP tqt)| {z }
=(Pt−VWAP t)qt+ (VWAP tqt−VWAP tQt)| {z }
=VWAP t(qt−Qt).(8)
Substituting this into (7) yields:
ST=TX
t=1[(Pt−VWAP t)qt+VWAP t(qt−Qt)]. (9)
Since the absolute value of a sum is generally not equal to the sum of the absolute values,
the triangle inequality is invoked:
TX
t=1at≤TX
t=1|at|.
Thus,
ST≤TX
t=1|(Pt−VWAP t)qt+VWAP t(qt−Qt)|. (10)
Furthermore, applying the triangle inequality to each individual term results in:
|(Pt−VWAP t)qt+VWAP t(qt−Qt)|
≤ |(Pt−VWAP t)qt|+|VWAP t(qt−Qt)|.(11)
6 Summing over tgives:
ST≤TX
t=1|(Pt−VWAP t)qt|+TX
t=1|VWAP t(qt−Qt)|. (12)
In this decomposition:
•|(Pt−VWAP t)qt|represents the deviation in price weighted by the executed volume
proportion.
•|VWAP t(qt−Qt)|captures the impact of discrepancies between the executed vol-
ume allocation and the market’s volume distribution.
Methodology — Delineating the Problems
In the pursuit of minimizing slippage, two distinct challenges are identified.
Problem 1: Price Deviation Minimization
This aspect focuses on minimizing:
TX
t=1|(Pt−VWAP t)qt|.
Key considerations include:
•Execution quality within each interval is paramount; the goal is to achieve prices as
close as possible to the market VWAP.
•With finer time intervals, price deviations are expected to be smaller, and deviations
across bins may partially offset one another.
•This challenge is primarily related to market microstructure and the quality of
executions.
Problem 2: Volume Allocation Optimization
This challenge is characterized by:
TX
t=1|VWAP t(qt−Qt)|. (13)
Key considerations include:
•Although VWAP tcannot be controlled, the executed volume allocation qtcan be
adjusted.
7 •Traditional methods focus on accurately predicting Qt, the market volume profile;
however, given the inherent uncertainty in market dynamics, this may not be
optimal.
•The strategy is to design a qtallocation that accounts for the noisy nature of the
Qtprocess, adapting to market conditions and prediction errors.
•For instance, during periods of low volatility, it may be advisable to execute less
than the market proportion Qtto mitigate the risk of sudden volatility spikes.
•The aim is to develop a robust volume allocation strategy that minimizes slippage
even when predictions of Qtare imperfect.
Choosing the Appropriate Focus
While the primary aim is to minimize absolute slippage, it is also essential to consider
strategies that not only meet the benchmark but also potentially outperform it.
Price Difference Focus
•Since the weights qtandQtare non-negative, achieving the most favorable prices in
each interval is crucial.
•Opportunities for value addition may arise, particularly through the mitigation of
trading costs such as the spread.
Volume Allocation Focus
•Given the challenges in precisely forecasting VWAP t, emphasis is placed on risk
reduction through effective volume allocation.
•The strategy aims to minimize the term |VWAP t(qt−Qt)|by aligning the executed
volume with the market’s volume profile.
•This involves leveraging insights into future market volumes and understanding
their interaction with market volatility.
•The focus is on developing the optimal qtstrategy for volume allocation over larger
time intervals, thereby reducing the risk associated with VWAP execution.
In summary, by rigorously decomposing the slippage STand carefully applying the
triangle inequality, the problem is separated into two distinct components: execution
quality (price differences) and volume allocation discrepancies. This detailed derivation
provides a solid foundation for subsequent analysis and strategy development.
8 4 A fixed optimal allocation curve approach
To demonstrate the validity of allocation strategies that are not based solely on following
the volume curve, an analysis was conducted in which an optimal allocation curve was
calibrated using only historical data, without incorporating current market information.
In this experiment, the allocation curve is represented by a simple vector of weights
that determines the fraction of the total order executed in each time bin. Without any
additional market inputs, the expected volume curve is a uniform distribution over the
execution period—precisely as conventional wisdom would predict—so any deviation from
this flat pattern in the optimal allocation would challenge that notion.
4.1 Methodology
Historical data from Binance perpetual futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum
(ETH), and Cardano (ADA) covering the period from contract inception until July 1,
2024, were employed. The data, recorded at an hourly frequency, were divided into
training and testing sets in an 80/20 split, with the temporal order preserved to ensure a
realistic evaluation. The VWAP execution problem was formulated as the optimization
of a vector of allocation weights, qt(fort= 1, . . . , Twith T= 8bins), by minimizing one
of three loss functions. The first is the Quadratic VWAP Loss, defined as
LQ=E"VWAP achieved

the second is the Absolute VWAP Loss,
LA=EVWAP achieved

and the third is the Volume Curve Loss,
LV=E

The achieved and market VWAP are defined respectively as
VWAP achieved =PT
t=1vtptPT
t=1vt, (17)
VWAP market =PT
t=1VtptPT
t=1Vt. (18)
Here, vtrepresents the allocated volume in bin t,Vtis the market volume in bin t, and pt
is the VWAP price in bin t. To solve the optimization problem, three different methods
were employed. Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) was used as a local
9 optimization technique with 1000 restarts from random initial guesses to mitigate the
risk of converging to local minima. Basin-Hopping, a global optimization algorithm that
combines local searches with random perturbations, was also employed and performed
10 times. In addition, Differential Evolution, an evolutionary algorithm known for its
robustness in finding global optima, was executed once. Performance metrics for each
asset, loss function, and optimization method are summarized in Table 1, while Figure 1
illustrates the optimal allocation curves derived from these optimizations.

Note: Abs VWAP Loss and Vol Curve Loss are presented in 102scale, Quad VWAP Loss
is presented in 104scale as per the original data.
The analysis reveals several important findings. Allocation curves obtained by mini-
mizing the absolute and quadratic VWAP losses clearly deviate from a uniform allocation,
while the optimization based on the volume curve loss yields a nearly flat allocation.
This flat allocation is expected since, in the absence of market information, the aver-
age volume in each time bin is equal. However, although the flat allocation perfectly
tracks the average volume curve (as evidenced by an R2near zero), it performs worse
in terms of VWAP execution compared to the non-uniform allocations derived from the
VWAP-based losses. Furthermore, among the assets studied, Bitcoin consistently exhibits
the lowest VWAP losses, reflecting its relative stability, whereas Cardano—being more
volatile—shows higher losses. In terms of optimization methods, Differential Evolution
consistently produced competitive results across assets and loss functions, while SLSQP,
despite numerous restarts, often converged to suboptimal solutions due to the complexity
of the optimization landscape. Basin-Hopping displayed variable performance that was
10 generally less consistent.

4.2 Discussion
This experiment is particularly revealing because it involves optimizing a vector of alloca-
tion weights using only historical data without current market information. Consequently,
an optimization based solely on the volume curve loss produces a flat, uniform alloca-
tion, which is expected when no additional information beyond the historical average is
available. In contrast, the allocation curves optimized using the absolute and quadratic
VWAP losses diverge significantly from uniformity, exhibiting a pronounced end-loading
behavior in some cases. This divergence indicates that even in the absence of direct market
signals, an allocation strategy that minimizes VWAP slippage is inherently non-uniform.
This finding challenges the traditional approach of following the expected volume curve
and strongly supports the use of direct VWAP loss optimization in trading execution
strategies. Although the empirically derived allocation curves deviate markedly from
the conventional volume curve, this outcome is not entirely surprising when considering
simplified frameworks that account for price–volume interactions. For instance, Konishi
[19] shows that the optimal fraction x∗(t)allocated to bin tcan be approximated by
x∗(t)≈E
σ(t, V)2X(t)
E
σ(t, V)2, (19)
or equivalently, as rewritten by McCulloch and Kazakov [23]:
xt=E[Xtσ2
t]
E[σ2
t]=E[Xt] +Cov[Xt, σ2
t]
E[σ2
t]. (20)
11 Thus, a sufficiently large positive covariance term can shift the solution away from the
market’s average volume curve, underscoring the role of volatility in shaping optimal
allocations. These results highlight the importance of the price–volume relationship and
expose the limitations of approaches based solely on replicating the historical volume
curve. Although more complex models can be developed to jointly account for both price
and volume dynamics, the present analysis demonstrates that even a relatively simple
(and naive) linear model can yield meaningful improvements in VWAP execution by
directly optimizing the VWAP objective.
5 A Deep-Learning Model for VWAP Allocation
5.1 Framework
Having demonstrated that the traditional volume curve approach may not be optimal for
allocating volumes over time, deep learning is employed as a powerful means to represent
and optimize the VWAP allocation problem. Deep learning affords the flexibility to
directly optimize the specific objective—minimizing the deviation between the achieved
execution price and the market VWAP—by leveraging automatic differentiation. In
this framework, the model accepts sequential inputs comprising multiple features over a
designated historical lookback period and produces an allocation curve for future time
intervals. The key innovation is the use of a custom loss function (either absolute or
quadratic VWAP loss) that captures the true execution error, thereby enabling the
optimization of the strategy in a single step rather than relying on intermediate proxies
such as the volume curve. A critical requirement is that the model’s output constitutes a
valid allocation strategy; that is, the allocation weights must be non-negative and sum
to one. Although several approaches (e.g., clipping negative values or taking absolute
values before normalization) were considered, these methods risk introducing uneven
optimization. Instead, the softmax function is adopted, which naturally transforms any
real-valued vector into a smooth probability distribution over the execution horizon. This
ensures that even if the Temporal Linear Network (TLN) produces negative values, the
final allocation vector remains both non-negative and normalized, thereby satisfying the
constraints without sacrificing optimization smoothness.
5.2 Internal Model
In selecting an internal model for the VWAP allocation framework, various architec-
tures traditionally employed for sequential prediction tasks were considered. Recent
studies in volume prediction for cryptocurrency markets have explored models such as
Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKAN) [10], Signature-Weighted Kolmogorov-
Arnold Networks (SigKAN) [ 16], Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformers (TKAT) [ 8],
Kolmogorov-Arnold Mixture of Experts (KAMoE) [ 15] and Recurrent Neural Networks
with Signature-Based Gating Mechanisms (SigGate) [ 11]. Although these approaches
offer innovative solutions for capturing long-term dependencies and complex interactions,
they also introduce additional complexity that is not necessary when the primary goal
12 is to demonstrate the importance of optimizing the correct objective. Accordingly, the
Temporal Linear Network (TLN) [ 9] was chosen as the default internal model. The TLN
is conceptually simple and highly interpretable—essentially a linear model with structured
transformations—yet it is integrated within a deep learning framework that enables the
minimization of arbitrary loss functions via automatic differentiation. Importantly, even
a naive linear model performs effectively within the proposed approach, emphasizing that
improvements arise from directly optimizing the VWAP execution objective rather than
from architectural complexity. Let the input tensor be
X∈RB×S×F,
where Bis the batch size, Sis the length of the input sequence, and Fis the number
of input features. The TLN consists of Llayers, each implementing a cascade of linear
operations. Each operation within a layer is a linear mapping with learnable weights,
and the layers are designed to progressively adjust both the sequence length and feature
dimension. This structured design leverages parameter sharing and constraints, resulting
in a model that is both computationally efficient and stable.
Each layer ℓ(with 1≤ℓ≤L) transforms its input X(ℓ−1)into an output X(ℓ)through
twoprimarystages: a structuredlineartransformation andaconvolutionalfiltering
along the time dimension.
1. Structured Linear Transformation
This stage is composed of three consecutive linear operations.
Temporal Scaling: Each time index is scaled by a learnable vector K(ℓ)∈RSℓ, where
Sℓdenotes the current sequence length at layer ℓ. For each batch index b, time index s,
and feature index f, the computation is as follows:
eX(ℓ)

5.3 The Role of Softmax in Enforcing Allocation Constraints
A key innovation in the framework is the use of the softmax function to enforce allocation
constraints. In this context, the final output of the internal model must be a valid
allocation vector—that is, all elements must be non-negative and the vector must sum
to one. While straightforward normalization (dividing by the sum of the outputs) or
clipping negative values might appear sufficient, these approaches can lead to uneven or
suboptimal optimization. In contrast, the softmax function
σ(z)i=ezi
PK
j=1ezj, (28)
naturally transforms any real-valued input vector zinto a smooth probability distribution.
This not only satisfies the constraints but also ensures a differentiable transformation
that facilitates gradient-based optimization. Even if the TLN produces negative values,
the exponential function within softmax guarantees a smooth and balanced allocation
across the execution horizon.
5.4 Comparison with Standard Linear Regression and Rationale
A conventional linear regression would flatten the input tensor X∈RB×S×FintoXflat∈
RB×(S·F)and compute
Y=XflatWreg+breg, (29)
resulting in a very large number of parameters. In contrast, the TLN architecture leverages
structured, layer-by-layer transformations to progressively adjust the sequence and feature
14 dimensions, yielding a much more parsimonious model that is less prone to unstable
weight estimates. Furthermore, by embedding the TLN within a deep learning framework,
it becomes possible to optimize non-traditional loss functions—such as the VWAP-specific
losses—using automatic differentiation, an advantage that standard linear regression does
not offer.
5.5 Summary of the Optimization Process
The overall optimization process proceeds in three primary steps. First, the TLN
processes the input features over a specified lookback period to generate a raw output
vector v[t,t+h]=TLN(xt)for future time steps. Next, the softmax function is applied to
these raw outputs to convert them into a valid allocation vector:
qt=evt
PT
s=1evs,fort= 1,2, . . . , T, (30)
ensuring that the allocations are non-negative and sum to one. Finally, the model
parameters θare optimized by minimizing the quadratic difference between the achieved
VWAP and the market VWAP, as defined in Section 4 (see Eqs. (14)–(18)). In summary,
this framework establishes a fair comparison platform by leveraging deep learning to
directlyoptimizetheVWAPexecutionobjective. Ratherthanincreasingmodelcomplexity,
the approach employs a straightforward, linear model (the TLN) enhanced by the softmax
transformation to enforce smooth and constrained allocation, demonstrating that aligning
the optimization objective precisely with the trading goal can lead to improved execution
performance.
6 Results
In this section, a comprehensive comparison of various VWAP execution strategies is
presented, including traditional methods, the proposed deep-learning approach, and
dynamic strategies. These methods are evaluated across different cryptocurrencies to
assess their performance under varying market conditions.
6.1 Benchmarks and Strategies
Several benchmark strategies are considered. As a baseline, a naive flat allocation strategy
that uniformly distributes the order volume across all time intervals is included; this
simple method serves as a reference for assessing more sophisticated approaches. In
addition, fixed optimal allocation curves are evaluated—static allocations optimized using
three different loss functions (absolute VWAP loss, quadratic VWAP loss, and volume
curve loss) as described in 4. For this optimization, the differential evolution algorithm is
employed due to its demonstrated superior and more stable performance. The proposed
deep-learning approach, referred to as the StaticVWAP Model , employs a neural network
to generate allocation curves based on historical market data. For a fair comparison, all
15 models receive the same input features, including volumes, the hour of the day, the day
of the week, and returns computed on the VWAP price of each bin. In contrast, the
Static Linear Regression model serves as a traditional benchmark that is calibrated to
predict the volume. Since linear regression does not inherently produce outputs that
satisfy the allocation constraints (i.e., non-negativity and summing to one), its predictions
are post-processed by first clipping negative values to zero and then normalizing the
resulting vector. In cases where all values are zero (or become zero after clipping), an
equiponderated allocation is returned. Dynamic VWAP strategies based on the framework
introduced by [ 3] are also implemented. In these dynamic strategies, the volume executed
at each time step is determined by the current market volume prediction and the remaining
order size, following the equation
vt=ˆVtPT
i=tˆVi· 
1−t−1X
i=0vi!
, (31)
where vtdenotes the volume executed at time t,ˆVtis the predicted market volume at
time t,Tis the end of the execution horizon, andPt−1
i=0virepresents the cumulative
executed volume up to time t−1. Both a dynamic linear regression approach and a
dynamic version of the StaticVWAP model, which updates predictions at each time step,
are considered.
6.2 Evaluation Metrics
Three key metrics are used to assess performance. The Absolute VWAP Loss measures
the absolute difference between the achieved VWAP and the market VWAP, while
theQuadratic VWAP Loss measures the squared difference, thereby penalizing larger
deviations more heavily. In addition, the R2Score for the Volume Curve is computed,
indicating how accurately the strategy predicts the actual market volume profile.
6.3 Experimental Setup
The strategies are evaluated using hourly data from five major cryptocurrencies (BTC,
ETH, BNB, ADA, and XRP) traded on Binance perpetual contracts covering the period
from January 1, 2020, to July 1, 2024. This dataset provides sufficient historical data
across varying market conditions to evaluate the models’ performance in both high and
low volatility regimes. The data is partitioned chronologically, with the last 20% reserved
as the test set to ensure a true out-of-sample evaluation. A validation set, comprising
20% of the remaining data, is randomly selected from the first 80% of the period to guide
model selection and prevent overfitting to any specific market regime.
For input features, several categories are incorporated: (1) Volume data, which is
transformed to address non-stationarity by dividing each volume value by a trailing
two-week moving average, calculated with appropriate shifting to avoid look-ahead bias;
(2) Temporal indicators including hour of day and day of week as categorical features to
16 capture seasonality patterns; and (3) Price information in the form of returns calculated
on the VWAP price of each bin, with a value of 0 assigned when no volume is traded.
The preparation of target variables differs based on the model type. For the neural
network approaches, the normalization to volume curve is implemented directly within
the loss function, with volumes divided by the sum over the lookback period for numerical
stability. For traditional linear regression models, the volume curve is explicitly normalized
by dividing each volume by the sum of volumes in the lookahead period, as these models
cannot incorporate this normalization within their loss functions.
In these experiments, a lookback period of 120 time steps is used to predict allocations
for 12 periods ahead. Additional experiments with modified parameters—one with a
6-step prediction horizon and a shorter lookback period, and another with a 48-step
prediction horizon—are provided in the Appendix. The results from these experiments
confirm that the framework is effective across different timeframes and that the underlying
concepts generalize well.
6.4 Training Details
Standard training settings were adopted. Specifically, the Adam optimizer was employed,
and the maximum number of epochs was set to 1000. To mitigate overfitting and ensure
stable convergence, two key callbacks were incorporated: an early stopping mechanism,
which halts training if no improvement in validation loss is observed for 10 consecutive
epochs, and a learning rate reducer, which divides the current learning rate by 4 after 5
epochs without improvement (starting from an initial rate of 0.001). The training set was
shuffled, and a 20% validation split was used to monitor these metrics during training.
An additional critical aspect was the mitigation of sensitivity to weight initialization.
Each training run was repeated 30 times with different random initializations to compute
both the average performance and its standard deviation, thereby providing a robust and
statistically sound evaluation of model effectiveness.
6.5 Empirical Results
Table 2 summarizes the performance of various VWAP execution strategies for a 12-step-
ahead allocation with a 120-step lookback window. The table reports the mean and
standard deviation of the Absolute VWAP Loss (scaled by 10−2), Quadratic VWAP Loss
(scaled by 10−4), the R2score for the volume curve, and the training time (in seconds)
for each strategy, across five assets (BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, and XRP).
Severalkeypatternsemergefromtheseresults. First, allproposedmethodsconsistently
outperform the naive flat allocation approach across all assets, confirming that more
sophisticated allocation strategies yield tangible benefits for VWAP execution.

When comparing the methods based on their ability to predict volume curves, we
observe that Static Linear Regression is more effective than the StaticVWAP model when
the latter is optimized for absolute or quadratic VWAP loss. However, the Dynamic
Linear Regression approach consistently achieves the highest R2values across all assets,
indicating superior volume curve prediction capability. This improved prediction translates
into better VWAP execution compared to Static Linear Regression.
18 Interestingly, despite Dynamic Linear Regression’s advantage in volume prediction, the
Fixed Volume Curve approach demonstrates superior VWAP execution performance. This
finding underscores a critical insight: accurate volume curve prediction, while beneficial,
is not the primary determinant of optimal VWAP execution.
Mostsignificantly, theproposedStaticVWAPdeeplearningmodelconsistentlyachieves
the best absolute or quadratic VWAP loss values (depending on its optimization target)
across all assets. When trained to minimize absolute VWAP loss, it delivers the lowest
absolute slippage; similarly, when optimized for quadratic VWAP loss, it produces the
lowest quadratic slippage metrics.
Regarding training times, the deep-learning models (StaticVWAP) generally require
between 15 and 18 seconds per run, which, although longer than the near-instantaneous
training times of linear regression models, represents an acceptable trade-off given the
significant performance gains. The dynamic approaches show mixed results when applied
to the StaticVWAP model, often degrading performance rather than improving it.
Overall, these results validate the central thesis of this study: directly optimizing the
VWAP execution objective—rather than focusing solely on volume curve prediction—is
essential for achieving superior execution performance in volatile markets such as cryp-
tocurrencies. The StaticVWAP deep learning framework provides a flexible and effective
approach that consistently outperforms conventional methods, even when utilizing a
relatively simple model architecture.
6.6 Training Times and Comparison Across Prediction Horizons
Tables 3 and 4 provide additional insight into the practical applicability of each method
under different prediction horizons. Several consistent patterns emerge across these
timeframes that reinforce the findings from our main experiments.
First, regarding training efficiency, the StaticVWAP models consistently maintain rea-
sonable computational demands across all horizons—typically under 20 seconds—making
them practical for real-world applications despite being more complex than linear re-
gression models. Notably, while the fixed volume curve approach converges rapidly for
shorter horizons, its training time increases dramatically with longer prediction horizons,
eventually requiring several minutes per run for 48-step predictions.
When examining performance across different timeframes, the relative rankings of
the models remain remarkably consistent. For both shorter (6-step) and longer (48-
step) prediction horizons, the StaticVWAP models optimized directly for VWAP loss
consistently outperform both naive approaches and linear regression variants. The fixed
volume curve approach remains competitive, particularly when optimized with quadratic
loss, but generally does not reach the performance levels of the StaticVWAP model.
Dynamicapproachesshowconsistentpatternsacrossdifferenthorizons. Dynamiclinear
regression demonstrates increasingly strong volume curve prediction capability (higher
R2values) as the prediction horizon extends, yet this improvement in volume prediction
19 does not translate to proportional gains in VWAP execution performance. This pattern
strongly supports our central thesis that accurate volume prediction, while informative, is
not the primary driver of optimal VWAP execution. In fact, the performance gap between
methods directly optimized for VWAP execution and those focused on volume prediction
tends to persist or even widen with longer horizons.
The stability of these findings across different prediction horizons and assets under-
scores the robustness of our approach. Whether executing shorter or longer-term VWAP
strategies, directly optimizing the execution objective consistently yields superior results
compared to approaches that rely primarily on volume curve prediction.
6.7 Limitations and Future Directions
Although the proposed approach yields promising improvements in VWAP execution,
several limitations warrant discussion. One key assumption in the current framework is
that market impact is negligible. This assumption is common in the VWAP literature,
as employing a VWAP benchmark over a long period is believed to mitigate market
impact. However, it is recognized that large order sizes may affect execution quality.
Studies such as Gueant et al. have shown that both temporary and permanent market
impact components can be incorporated into the optimization process, suggesting that
future work could integrate such models to more accurately capture real-world trading
dynamics. Another limitation is that the present model operates in a static framework
without dynamic updating in real time. Although static models have the advantage of
simplicity and reduced technological complexity, dynamic adjustments could potentially
enhance execution performance in highly volatile environments. Future research may
explore hybrid approaches that combine the benefits of static optimization with dynamic
market adaptation. Finally, while the analysis in this study focuses on cryptocurrency
markets, the underlying principles are readily extendable to other asset classes such as
equities. Incorporating more sophisticated market impact models and dynamic updating
mechanismswillbevaluableindevelopingacomprehensiveframeworkforVWAPexecution
across diverse trading environments.
6.8 Understanding the Predicted Curves
An analysis of the predicted allocation curves under different calibration losses is presented
to elucidate how the proposed model differentiates itself from competing approaches.
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate that the predictions generated using absolute and quadratic
VWAP losses tend to follow an average allocation pattern similar to that observed in
Section 2, while still adapting to current market conditions. Notably, the model trained
with quadratic loss produces a more compact prediction region, suggesting that it sacrifices
flexibility in favor of an end-loaded execution pattern. In contrast, the model trained
with volume curve loss results in a nearly flat allocation, with distinct seasonal variations
clearly visible. These visual differences provide important insight into how the choice
of loss function shapes the resulting allocation strategy, ultimately contributing to the
performance differences observed in the quantitative analysis.

Incontrast, Figure4showstheallocationcurvefromamodeltrainedwithvolumecurve
21 loss, which is noticeably flatter and exhibits distinct seasonal waves. These differences
underscore that directly optimizing the VWAP objective (via absolute or quadratic loss)
yields a strategy that deviates from simply mimicking the historical volume curve.

6.9 Understanding When It Makes a Difference
To further assess the effectiveness of the approach, an analysis of the temporal evolution
of slippage (i.e., the difference between the achieved VWAP and the market VWAP)
relative to the price is provided. Figure 5 shows the slippage across the full out-of-sample
period for the naive approach, a dynamic VWAP strategy, and the proposed static
approach when executing a 48-hour VWAP in hourly bins. Notably, the proposed method
generally exhibits lower slippage during periods of high volatility, and in some instances,
the slippage even reverses sign relative to standard approaches. To illustrate this effect
in greater detail, Figure 6 provides a zoomed-in view over a 2000-hour subperiod. The
reduced magnitude and frequency of extreme slippage events in the proposed approach
are evident in this more focused view. Finally, Figures 7 and 8 present the differences
in absolute slippage between the proposed method (or the dynamic linear method) and
the naive approach. In these plots, negative values indicate lower absolute slippage (and
thus improved performance) relative to the naive strategy, while positive values indicate
higher slippage. The prevalence of negative values during volatile periods provides strong
visual evidence that the end-loaded allocation strategy is effective in mitigating execution
slippage.

Negative values indicate improved performance over the naive approach.
7 Conclusion
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that directly optimizing the VWAP
execution objective through a deep learning framework yields substantial performance
24 improvements over traditional volume curve-based approaches. More broadly, this ex-
ample illustrates that in many cases where multi-step methods or proxy variables have
traditionally been employed, deep learning offers a powerful alternative by enabling
direct optimization of the true objective. The expressivity of deep learning allows for
straightforward modifications to incorporate any function of market impact, thereby
providing a versatile platform for capturing complex trading dynamics.
Although a simple, naive linear model (the Temporal Linear Network) was employed,
its success is attributable to the fundamentally different approach of targeting the VWAP
execution objective directly. This shift in methodology not only enhances execution per-
formance but also underscores the potential of deep learning to transform similar problems
in other domains. I believe that this research represents a significant advancement in the
design of VWAP execution strategies, and I anticipate that further enhancements—such
as dynamic updating mechanisms and the integration of sophisticated market impact
models—will extend the applicability of this approach to a broader range of asset classes
and trading environments.
