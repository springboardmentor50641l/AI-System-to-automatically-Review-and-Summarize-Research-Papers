  "introduction": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial \nintelligence (AI) in which algorithms capable of understanding, \nprocessing, and generating human language are developed (Jurafsky \n& Martin, 2014). Large language models (LLMs), which can quickly \nevaluate large amounts of numerical and textual content, solve \nproblems, and provide unique insights, have brought a new breath to \nNLP (Touvron et al., 2023; Callanan et al., 2023; Wang, Li, Wu, Soon, & \nZhang, 2023). Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which is a \ntype of LLM that can perform various NLP tasks such as answering \nquestions and summarising the given text, is groundbreaking in many \nareas (George, George & Martin, 2023; Callanan et al., 2023; Fatouros, \nSoldatos, Kouroumali, Makridis & Kyriazi, 2023). \nThe company that creates GPT models, OpenAI, keeps refining \nthe architecture by expanding training on more datasets, adding new \nlayers to GPT models, and making technical improvements. So much \nso that GPT-1, which was first developed in 2018, can be trained on a \nlarge dataset and understand and copy patterns in human language \n(Radford, Narasimhan, Salimans, & Sutskever, 2018). GPT-2, released \n\n \n \nİnci Merve ALTAN, Metin KILIÇ \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n243 \nin 2019, can create realistic human-like texts (OpenAI, 2019). GPT-3, \nwhich was introduced in 2020 and has a customisable structure, \nprovides outstanding results in many tasks such as text completion, \ntranslation, and question-answering (OpenAI, 2021). Finally, in March \n2023, GPT-4, which can compose songs, write scripts, or create creative \nand technical writing tasks with users, such as learning the user's \nwriting style and generating safe and useful answers, was introduced \nas the successor of GPT-3 (OpenAI, 2023). \nChatGPT, a special version of the constantly evolving GPT \narchitecture finely tuned for conversational applications, was released \ntowards the end of 2022. The launch of ChatGPT has attracted a lot of \npeople's attention. ChatGPT is described as the fastest-growing \nconsumer application, as it reached one million users within five days \nof its launch (Hofert, 2023). \nMicrosoft introduced Bing AI in early 2023, an AI-powered \nsearch engine that uses advanced techniques to provide answers to \nquestions, powered by OpenAI's Prometheus Model 1. Bing AI \ncombines its answers with the creative reasoning abilities of advanced \nGPT models (Krause, 2023). The most important difference between \nGPT-4 enabled Bing AI and GPT-3 enabled ChatGPT is that its current \ndata is reliable data obtained from web pages, encyclopaedias, and \npictures. The explanation is that it can perform certain specific tasks, \nsuch as making weather forecasts. \nThe reasons why artificial intelligence applications are so \nwidespread today in terms of academia, industry, and individual users \nare health (Cascella, Montomoli, Bellini & Bignami, 2023; Li, Dada, \nKleesiek & Egger, 2023; Biswas, 2023), education (Adeshola & \n\n \n \nScience Fiction to Real Life: Bing AI as An Investment Advisor \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n244 \nAdepoju, 2023; Grassini, 2023; Biswas, 2023), business (George et al., \n2023; Chu, 2023; Derdiyok, Unal & Doğru, 2023; Ahangar & Fietko, \n2023; Dowling & Lucey, 2023; Fatouros et al., 2023; Guo, Xu, & Yang, \n2023), etc. This is due to the fact that it offers services in many different \nareas. Espacially, The capabilities of artificial intelligence are beyond \nhuman power in the field of finance and have begun to be described as \npowerful tools that can improve various aspects of financial analysis \n(Krause, 2023). Therefore, by synthesising data, artificial intelligence \nmodels help analysts, managers, and investors achieve high \nperformance in creating financial reports, detecting risks, predicting \nmarket trends, and optimising portfolios (Forbes, 2023). It is important \nto determine to what extent it fulfils all these functions. Because of this, \nthe study's objectives are to ascertain artificial intelligence's financial \naptitude in the domain of finance and assess its effectiveness using a \ncase study on investment analysis. By exposing the advantages and \ndisadvantages of artificial intelligence applications, it seeks to \nsignificantly advance the rapidly evolving field of financial analysis \nbacked by AI. Furthermore, when the literature was examined, no \nsimilar study examining the investment consultancy of the GPT-4 \nenabled Bing AI application for BIST data was found, and the study is \na first in this respect. \nThere are four sections to the study. The first section provides \ngeneral information regarding GPTs and large language models in \nartificial intelligence, along with an explanation of their applications. \nIn order to uncover the financial capabilities of artificial intelligence \nand assess its performance through an investment analysis case study, \na conceptual framework derived from studies on the application of AI \n\n \n \nİnci Merve ALTAN, Metin KILIÇ \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n245 \nin finance was created in the second part. In the third part, the risk and \nreturn of the portfolio were analysed by building a portfolio using \nBIST100 data on the Bing AI application. Ultimately, the results are \nexplained in the fourth chapter. \n \nLiterature \nThe dynamic structure of finance has become more \nunderstandable and interpretable with artificial intelligence models. In \nparticular, LLMs and generative artificial intelligence applications are \namong the biggest supporters of the development of finance. \nResearchers and industries have worked to specialise artificial \nintelligence in the field of finance with various LLMs regulated in \nfinancial NLP fields such as InvestLM (Yang, Tang & Tam, 2023), \nFinMA (Xie, Han, Zhang, Lai, Peng, Lopez-Lira & Huang, 2023), \nFinEval (Zhang, Cai, Liu, Yang, Dai, Liao, Qin, Li, Liu, Liu, Zhu, Wu, \nGuo, & Chen, 2023), FinGPT (Wang, Yang, & Wang, 2023; Yang, Liu, \nWang, 2023), Gpt-finRE (Rajpoot & Parikh, 2023), FinVis-GPT (Wang, \nLi, Wu, Soon & Zhang, 2023), FinBERT (Liu, Huang, Huang, Li, Zhao, \n2021; Huang, Wang & Yang, 2023; Araci, 2019) and BloomberGPT \n(Wu, Irsoy, Lu, Dabravolski, Dredze, Gehrmann, Kambadur, \nRosenberg & Mann, 2023). \nAlthough studies have been conducted on a wide range of \ntopics using ChatGPT and Bing AI, two special versions of the GPT \narchitecture finely tuned for speech applications, the studies generally \nfocus on education (Adeshola & Adepoju, 2023; Grassini, 2023; Biswas, \n2023a), health (Cascella et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Biswas, 2023b; \nPradana, Elisa & Syarifuddin, 2023), and finance (Wenzlaff & Spaeth, \n2022; Hofert, 2023; Derdiyok et al., 2023; Guo, Xui & Yang, 2023; \n\n \n \nScience Fiction to Real Life: Bing AI as An Investment Advisor \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n246 \nAhangar & Fietko, 2023; Dowling & Lucey, 2023). Some studies using \nartificial intelligence in the field of finance are summarised below. \nKrause (2023) examined the applications of ChatGPT, Bard, and \nBing AI language models in the field of finance. According to the \nfindings of the study, these three major language models show \nsignificant potential for improving financial analysis, automating \ntasks, and providing valuable information. \nFatouros et al. (2023) conducted sentiment analysis in the \nfinancial field with ChatGPT in their study. They conducted a \ncomprehensive examination by subjecting ChatGPT to various \nrequests on a meticulously curated dataset comprising headlines \nrelated to forex news, employing a zero-shot prompting approach. \nWith this study, they shed light on the potential of ChatGPT to \nsignificantly increase sentiment analysis in financial applications. \nCallanan et al. (2023) used exam questions from the Chartered \nFinancial Analyst (CFA) Programme to make a comprehensive \nevaluation of ChatGPT1 and GPT-42 in financial analysis, taking into \naccount Zero Shot, Chain of Thought (CoT), and Low Shot, in order to \nexamine whether GPT models are financial analysts or not. They \nexamined whether intelligence models would pass the test. Their \nstudy sheds light on the financial foundations of future LLMs. \nDerdiyok et al. (2023) investigated ChatGPT's ability to detect \nthe financial status of companies. They aimed to comprehensively \nanalyse the financial statements of the companies traded in Borsa \nIstanbul by using the capital structure score, profitability score related \nto the income and expense statement, and cash flow score related to \nthe cash flow statement. To examine how successful the scores \n\n \n \nİnci Merve ALTAN, Metin KILIÇ \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n247 \nmeasured by ChatGPT were, they tracked the development of certain \nperformance criteria in the year after the score was calculated. \nAccording to their findings, they have found that ChatGPT, which is \nstill in its development stage, can successfully detect the financial \nsituations of publicly traded companies on the stock exchange, \nprovided the necessary data for analysis is provided. \nKüçüker (2023) basic-level questions created on financial \naccounting, cost-management accounting, and auditing themes were \ndirected to the model, and evaluations were done within the scope of \nthe responses received in order to assess ChatGPT's proficiency in \nfundamental accounting concerns. In accordance with the study's \nconclusions, he said that ChatGPT might have a lot of chances for use \nin the accounting industry in the years to come, but that the model's \nfeatures needed to be developed for accounting applications. \nStudies in the literature about the financial success of artificial \nintelligence show the potential of artificial intelligence to replace \nhumans. However, it is noteworthy that the majority of the studies \nwere carried out via ChatGPT. The fact that ChatGPT cannot access \ncurrent data and the last training date is January 2022 limits the \nstudies. The fact that there are many artificial intelligence models other \nthan ChatGPT casts doubt on the emphasis of most studies in the \nliterature that artificial intelligence needs to be developed. \nAccordingly, in order to examine the financial capabilities of artificial \nintelligence, Bing AI's investment recommendations are examined in \nthe next section. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nScience Fiction to Real Life: Bing AI as An Investment Advisor \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n248 \nCase Study \nThe capabilities of artificial intelligence in the field of finance \nare beyond human power. Therefore, it is known that artificial \nintelligence models can help analysts, managers, and investors with \nsuperhuman performance in creating financial reports, detecting risks, \npredicting market trends, and optimising portfolios by synthesising \ndata (Forbes, 2023). One of the questions that needs to be determined \nis how effectively and correctly it carries out all these functions. For \nthis reason, Bing AI with the GPT-4 feature, which is a text-based \nartificial intelligence engine that can perform the functions of \nproviding information to users, answering questions, and creating \ncontent, was used in the study. \nTo measure Bing AI's financial investment advisory ability, it \nwas first asked how many stocks an ideal portfolio should consist of. \nBing AI answered this question briefly as follows: you can aim for 6-7 \nstocks in a portfolio up to 100,000 TL, and up to 10 stocks in larger \nportfolios. Based on this answer, Bing AI was asked to select six stocks \nin BIST100 according to traditional and modern portfolio theories, \ntaking into account the 2019–2022 balance sheets and income \nstatements. However, it recommended a portfolio consisting of the \nsame stocks, according to both traditional and modern portfolio \ntheories. The portfolio created by Bing AI is given in Table 1. \nTable 1: Portfolio created by Bing AI \nNotation \nStock’s Name \nAKBNK \nAkbank Inc. \nGARAN \nTürkiye Garanti Bank Inc. \nASELS \nAselsan Electronic Industry and Trade Inc. \nTHYAO \nTurkish Airlines Inc. \nTTKOM \nTürk Telecommunication Inc. \nKCHOL \nKoç Holding Inc. \n\n \n \nİnci Merve ALTAN, Metin KILIÇ \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n249 \nWhen the portfolio produced by Bing AI in Table 1 is examined, \nit is seen that it consists of stocks belonging to businesses operating in \nthe banking, IT, transportation, and industry sectors. When Bing AI \nwas asked about the weight of stocks in the portfolio, it stated that they \nwere of equal weight. However, although it was asked to calculate the \nrisk and return of the portfolio, it stated that it did not have the ability \nto do this and suggested that it consult a financial advisor. \nIn order to make a more realistic assessment of the financial \nsuccess of the portfolio created by Bing AI, the risk and return of the \nportfolio must be known. For this, first the risks and returns of the \nstocks included in the portfolio must be determined. The returns of the \nstocks are determined by eq.

  "conclusion": "Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which is a type of \nLLM that can perform various NLP tasks such as answering questions \nasked in developing technology and summarising the given text, \nbreaks new ground in many areas. Nowadays, safe and helpful GPT \nmodels are available to generate responses for co-creating innovative \nand technical writing tasks with viewers, such as authoring \nscreenplays, songs, or analysing the individual's writing style. \nThe capabilities of artificial intelligence in many areas are \nbeyond human power in the field of finance. For this reason, they have \nbegun to be described as powerful tools that can improve various \naspects of financial analysis (Krause, 2023). Therefore, by synthesising \ndata, generative artificial intelligence models help analysts, managers, \nand investors achieve high performance in creating financial reports, \ndetecting risks, predicting market trends, and optimising portfolios \n(Forbes, 2023). The study aims to discover the financial capabilities of \nartificial intelligence in the field of finance and evaluate its \nperformance through an investment analysis case study. In this regard, \nMicrosoft leveraged Bing AI, an AI-powered search engine that uses \nadvanced techniques to provide answers to questions, powered by \nOpenAI's Prometheus Model 1. Bing AI was asked to analyse the \nfinancial statements of the companies in the BIST100 index for the \nyears 2019–2022 and create two portfolios according to traditional and \nmodern portfolio theories. On the other hand, Bing AI has proposed a \nsingle portfolio consisting of AKBNK, GARAN, ASELS, THYAO, \nTTKOM, and KCHOL stocks, taking into account both modern and \ntraditional portfolio approaches. When Bing AI was asked about the \n\n \n \nScience Fiction to Real Life: Bing AI as An Investment Advisor \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n254 \nweight of stocks in the portfolio, it stated that they were of equal \nweight. \nAs a case study, the risks and returns of the portfolio proposed \nby Bing AI in the period January 2023–November 2023 were examined \nin order to measure the degree of its capabilities in the financial field. \nAccordingly, the risks and returns of the stocks included in the \nportfolio were examined, and when the average returns were \nexamined, it was seen that the stock with the lowest return and highest \nrisk was ASELS, and the average returns of the other stocks had very \nsimilar risk returns. When the risk and return of the portfolio \nrecommended by Bing AI were calculated, it was found that the \nportfolio had a return of 3.8% against a risk of 14.8%. It is clear from \nthe Sample-2 portfolio that if the stocks suggested by Bing AI are \nweighted into different alternatives, there are higher possibilities of \nachieving them at lower risk. \nAlthough the risk of the portfolio created by Bing AI is \nrelatively high, at least the positive return gives hope for the success of \nBing AI's investment consultancy. However, the fact that he only gives \nliterary answers when asked to use both modern portfolio and \ntraditional portfolio methods, and his inability to apply this \ninformation when creating a portfolio, casts a shadow on the reliability \nof the suggestion he offers. In addition, although the portfolio \nsuggested by Bing AI provides positive returns, it is possible to say \nthat there is a need to improve the financial capabilities of Bing AI, as \nthere are more effective portfolios such as Sample 1–3 created with \ndifferent weighting combinations of the same stocks. In general, when \nthe financial capabilities of Bing AI are evaluated, it is impossible not \n\n \n \nİnci Merve ALTAN, Metin KILIÇ \n \nJEBM \nEkonomi, İşletme ve Yönetim Dergisi \nJournal of Economy, Business, and Management \nISSN: 2602-4195 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n255 \nto say that it provides support to people who have basic knowledge in \nthe field of finance. In future studies, the financial analysis, evaluation, \nand interpretation abilities of artificial intelligence models can be \nexamined, the expectations of artificial intelligence in the field of \nfinance can be revealed, and suggestions can be made to artificial \nintelligence developers.",
