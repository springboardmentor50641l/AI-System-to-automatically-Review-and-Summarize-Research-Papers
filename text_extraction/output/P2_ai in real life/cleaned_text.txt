Abstract 
Nowadays, generative artificial intelligence models have 
extensive applications, including finance. Artificial intelligence models 
in finance synthesise data to assist analysts in generating financial 
reports, detecting risks, predicting market trends, and optimising 
portfolios for managers and investors. However, it is crucial to 
determine the effectiveness of these financial functions. Therefore, this 
study aims to explore the financial capabilities of artificial intelligence 
in the finance domain and evaluate its performance through a case 
study on investment analysis. Within the scope of the study, a text-
based artificial intelligence engine, Bing AI, was utilised to explore the 
financial capabilities of artificial intelligence. Bing AI was tasked with 
creating portfolios for companies listed on the BIST100 index based on

their financial statements from 2019-2022, according to modern and 
traditional portfolio theories. The success of artificial intelligence in the 
financial field was evaluated by calculating the risk and return of the 
portfolio recommended by Bing AI for the period January 2023–
November 2023. The findings indicate that Bing AI has the potential to 
partially support individuals with basic financial knowledge, but there 
is a need for further development in the application of finance.

Introduction 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial 
intelligence (AI) in which algorithms capable of understanding, 
processing, and generating human language are developed (Jurafsky 
& Martin, 2014). Large language models (LLMs), which can quickly 
evaluate large amounts of numerical and textual content, solve 
problems, and provide unique insights, have brought a new breath to 
NLP (Touvron et al., 2023; Callanan et al., 2023; Wang, Li, Wu, Soon, & 
Zhang, 2023). Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which is a 
type of LLM that can perform various NLP tasks such as answering 
questions and summarising the given text, is groundbreaking in many 
areas (George, George & Martin, 2023; Callanan et al., 2023; Fatouros, 
Soldatos, Kouroumali, Makridis & Kyriazi, 2023). 
The company that creates GPT models, OpenAI, keeps refining 
the architecture by expanding training on more datasets, adding new 
layers to GPT models, and making technical improvements. So much 
so that GPT-1, which was first developed in 2018, can be trained on a 
large dataset and understand and copy patterns in human language 
(Radford, Narasimhan, Salimans, & Sutskever, 2018). GPT-2, released

in 2019, can create realistic human-like texts (OpenAI, 2019). GPT-3, 
which was introduced in 2020 and has a customisable structure, 
provides outstanding results in many tasks such as text completion, 
translation, and question-answering (OpenAI, 2021). Finally, in March 
2023, GPT-4, which can compose songs, write scripts, or create creative 
and technical writing tasks with users, such as learning the user's 
writing style and generating safe and useful answers, was introduced 
as the successor of GPT-3 (OpenAI, 2023). 
ChatGPT, a special version of the constantly evolving GPT 
architecture finely tuned for conversational applications, was released 
towards the end of 2022. The launch of ChatGPT has attracted a lot of 
people's attention. ChatGPT is described as the fastest-growing 
consumer application, as it reached one million users within five days 
of its launch (Hofert, 2023). 
Microsoft introduced Bing AI in early 2023, an AI-powered 
search engine that uses advanced techniques to provide answers to 
questions, powered by OpenAI's Prometheus Model 1. Bing AI 
combines its answers with the creative reasoning abilities of advanced 
GPT models (Krause, 2023). The most important difference between 
GPT-4 enabled Bing AI and GPT-3 enabled ChatGPT is that its current 
data is reliable data obtained from web pages, encyclopaedias, and 
pictures. The explanation is that it can perform certain specific tasks, 
such as making weather forecasts. 
The reasons why artificial intelligence applications are so 
widespread today in terms of academia, industry, and individual users 
are health (Cascella, Montomoli, Bellini & Bignami, 2023; Li, Dada, 
Kleesiek & Egger, 2023; Biswas, 2023), education (Adeshola &

Adepoju, 2023; Grassini, 2023; Biswas, 2023), business (George et al., 
2023; Chu, 2023; Derdiyok, Unal & Doğru, 2023; Ahangar & Fietko, 
2023; Dowling & Lucey, 2023; Fatouros et al., 2023; Guo, Xu, & Yang, 
2023), etc. This is due to the fact that it offers services in many different 
areas. Espacially, The capabilities of artificial intelligence are beyond 
human power in the field of finance and have begun to be described as 
powerful tools that can improve various aspects of financial analysis 
(Krause, 2023). Therefore, by synthesising data, artificial intelligence 
models help analysts, managers, and investors achieve high 
performance in creating financial reports, detecting risks, predicting 
market trends, and optimising portfolios (Forbes, 2023). It is important 
to determine to what extent it fulfils all these functions. Because of this, 
the study's objectives are to ascertain artificial intelligence's financial 
aptitude in the domain of finance and assess its effectiveness using a 
case study on investment analysis. By exposing the advantages and 
disadvantages of artificial intelligence applications, it seeks to 
significantly advance the rapidly evolving field of financial analysis 
backed by AI. Furthermore, when the literature was examined, no 
similar study examining the investment consultancy of the GPT-4 
enabled Bing AI application for BIST data was found, and the study is 
a first in this respect. 
There are four sections to the study. The first section provides 
general information regarding GPTs and large language models in 
artificial intelligence, along with an explanation of their applications. 
In order to uncover the financial capabilities of artificial intelligence 
and assess its performance through an investment analysis case study, 
a conceptual framework derived from studies on the application of AI

in finance was created in the second part. In the third part, the risk and 
return of the portfolio were analysed by building a portfolio using 
BIST100 data on the Bing AI application. Ultimately, the results are 
explained in the fourth chapter. 
 
Literature 
The dynamic structure of finance has become more 
understandable and interpretable with artificial intelligence models. In 
particular, LLMs and generative artificial intelligence applications are 
among the biggest supporters of the development of finance. 
Researchers and industries have worked to specialise artificial 
intelligence in the field of finance with various LLMs regulated in 
financial NLP fields such as InvestLM (Yang, Tang & Tam, 2023), 
FinMA (Xie, Han, Zhang, Lai, Peng, Lopez-Lira & Huang, 2023), 
FinEval (Zhang, Cai, Liu, Yang, Dai, Liao, Qin, Li, Liu, Liu, Zhu, Wu, 
Guo, & Chen, 2023), FinGPT (Wang, Yang, & Wang, 2023; Yang, Liu, 
Wang, 2023), Gpt-finRE (Rajpoot & Parikh, 2023), FinVis-GPT (Wang, 
Li, Wu, Soon & Zhang, 2023), FinBERT (Liu, Huang, Huang, Li, Zhao, 
2021; Huang, Wang & Yang, 2023; Araci, 2019) and BloomberGPT 
(Wu, Irsoy, Lu, Dabravolski, Dredze, Gehrmann, Kambadur, 
Rosenberg & Mann, 2023). 
Although studies have been conducted on a wide range of 
topics using ChatGPT and Bing AI, two special versions of the GPT 
architecture finely tuned for speech applications, the studies generally 
focus on education (Adeshola & Adepoju, 2023; Grassini, 2023; Biswas, 
2023a), health (Cascella et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Biswas, 2023b; 
Pradana, Elisa & Syarifuddin, 2023), and finance (Wenzlaff & Spaeth, 
2022; Hofert, 2023; Derdiyok et al., 2023; Guo, Xui & Yang, 2023;

Ahangar & Fietko, 2023; Dowling & Lucey, 2023). Some studies using 
artificial intelligence in the field of finance are summarised below. 
Krause (2023) examined the applications of ChatGPT, Bard, and 
Bing AI language models in the field of finance. According to the 
findings of the study, these three major language models show 
significant potential for improving financial analysis, automating 
tasks, and providing valuable information. 
Fatouros et al. (2023) conducted sentiment analysis in the 
financial field with ChatGPT in their study. They conducted a 
comprehensive examination by subjecting ChatGPT to various 
requests on a meticulously curated dataset comprising headlines 
related to forex news, employing a zero-shot prompting approach. 
With this study, they shed light on the potential of ChatGPT to 
significantly increase sentiment analysis in financial applications. 
Callanan et al. (2023) used exam questions from the Chartered 
Financial Analyst (CFA) Programme to make a comprehensive 
evaluation of ChatGPT1 and GPT-42 in financial analysis, taking into 
account Zero Shot, Chain of Thought (CoT), and Low Shot, in order to 
examine whether GPT models are financial analysts or not. They 
examined whether intelligence models would pass the test. Their 
study sheds light on the financial foundations of future LLMs. 
Derdiyok et al. (2023) investigated ChatGPT's ability to detect 
the financial status of companies. They aimed to comprehensively 
analyse the financial statements of the companies traded in Borsa 
Istanbul by using the capital structure score, profitability score related 
to the income and expense statement, and cash flow score related to 
the cash flow statement. To examine how successful the scores

measured by ChatGPT were, they tracked the development of certain 
performance criteria in the year after the score was calculated. 
According to their findings, they have found that ChatGPT, which is 
still in its development stage, can successfully detect the financial 
situations of publicly traded companies on the stock exchange, 
provided the necessary data for analysis is provided. 
Küçüker (2023) basic-level questions created on financial 
accounting, cost-management accounting, and auditing themes were 
directed to the model, and evaluations were done within the scope of 
the responses received in order to assess ChatGPT's proficiency in 
fundamental accounting concerns. In accordance with the study's 
conclusions, he said that ChatGPT might have a lot of chances for use 
in the accounting industry in the years to come, but that the model's 
features needed to be developed for accounting applications. 
Studies in the literature about the financial success of artificial 
intelligence show the potential of artificial intelligence to replace 
humans. However, it is noteworthy that the majority of the studies 
were carried out via ChatGPT. The fact that ChatGPT cannot access 
current data and the last training date is January 2022 limits the 
studies. The fact that there are many artificial intelligence models other 
than ChatGPT casts doubt on the emphasis of most studies in the 
literature that artificial intelligence needs to be developed. 
Accordingly, in order to examine the financial capabilities of artificial 
intelligence, Bing AI's investment recommendations are examined in 
the next section.

Case Study 
The capabilities of artificial intelligence in the field of finance 
are beyond human power. Therefore, it is known that artificial 
intelligence models can help analysts, managers, and investors with 
superhuman performance in creating financial reports, detecting risks, 
predicting market trends, and optimising portfolios by synthesising 
data (Forbes, 2023). One of the questions that needs to be determined 
is how effectively and correctly it carries out all these functions. For 
this reason, Bing AI with the GPT-4 feature, which is a text-based 
artificial intelligence engine that can perform the functions of 
providing information to users, answering questions, and creating 
content, was used in the study. 
To measure Bing AI's financial investment advisory ability, it 
was first asked how many stocks an ideal portfolio should consist of. 
Bing AI answered this question briefly as follows: you can aim for 6-7 
stocks in a portfolio up to 100,000 TL, and up to 10 stocks in larger 
portfolios. Based on this answer, Bing AI was asked to select six stocks 
in BIST100 according to traditional and modern portfolio theories, 
taking into account the 2019–2022 balance sheets and income 
statements. However, it recommended a portfolio consisting of the 
same stocks, according to both traditional and modern portfolio 
theories. The portfolio created by Bing AI is given in Table 1.

When the portfolio produced by Bing AI in Table 1 is examined, 
it is seen that it consists of stocks belonging to businesses operating in 
the banking, IT, transportation, and industry sectors. When Bing AI 
was asked about the weight of stocks in the portfolio, it stated that they 
were of equal weight. However, although it was asked to calculate the 
risk and return of the portfolio, it stated that it did not have the ability 
to do this and suggested that it consult a financial advisor. 
In order to make a more realistic assessment of the financial 
success of the portfolio created by Bing AI, the risk and return of the 
portfolio must be known. For this, first the risks and returns of the 
stocks included in the portfolio must be determined. The returns of the 
stocks are determined by eq. (1) (Güçlü & Şekkeli, 2020). 
𝐸𝐸(𝑅𝑅) = 𝑃𝑃−𝑃𝑃0
𝑃𝑃0
 
(1) 
Here 𝐸𝐸(𝑅𝑅) is the expected return of the stock, P is the future 
value prediction of the stock, and 𝑃𝑃0 is the present value of the stock. 
Monthly returns, variance, and standard deviation values for 
2023, calculated by substituting the monthly data obtained from 
investing.com into eq. (1) of the stocks in the portfolio created by Bing 
AI based on the financial statements of the 2019–2022 period, are given 
in Table 2.

Table 2 includes data on the monthly returns of the stocks 
recommended by Bing AI for the period January 2023–November 2023 
and their risks during this period. When we look at the average 
returns, it is seen that ASELS has the lowest return, while the average 
returns of other stocks are positive values that are very close to each 
other. When the variance and standard deviations of the risk tools are 
examined, it is seen that the stock with the highest risk is ASELS, and 
the other stocks have similar risk levels. In Table 2, only the return and 
risk interpretations of the six stocks included in the portfolio can be 
made. 
Eq. (2) is used to calculate the return of the portfolio consisting 
of n stocks.

Here 𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝 is the return of the portfolio, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 is weight of the i. stock 
in the portfolio, and 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 is the return on the i. stock. 
The return of the equally weighted portfolio created by Bing AI 
is calculated at 3.8% with eq. (2). In addition to the return on the 
portfolio, the risk level also needs to be calculated (Güçlü, 2022). 
Accordingly, the formulas used to calculate portfolio risk are included 
in eqs. (3)-(4). Note that these formulas ignore the asymmetry in the 
return data (Göktaş & Duran, 2019).

variance-covariances of the stocks included in the portfolio should be 
calculated. 
In order to calculate the risk of the portfolio created by Bing AI, 
the variance-covariance matrix of the stocks is needed. Accordingly, 
the variance-covariance matrix is given in Table 3.

By substituting the variance and covariance values in Table 3 of 
the equally weighted portfolio created by Bing AI into eq. (4), the risk 
of the portfolio is calculated as 14.8%. The risk and return values of the 
portfolio if the stocks are weighted differently are given in Table 4.

Table 4 shows the risks and returns of both the equally 
weighted portfolio of stocks recommended by Bing AI and alternative 
portfolio samples with different weights. Table 4 shows that Sample-2, 
among the portfolios offered as an alternative to Bing AI, can offer 
higher returns with lower risk compared to other portfolios.

Conclusion 
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which is a type of 
LLM that can perform various NLP tasks such as answering questions 
asked in developing technology and summarising the given text, 
breaks new ground in many areas. Nowadays, safe and helpful GPT 
models are available to generate responses for co-creating innovative 
and technical writing tasks with viewers, such as authoring 
screenplays, songs, or analysing the individual's writing style. 
The capabilities of artificial intelligence in many areas are 
beyond human power in the field of finance. For this reason, they have 
begun to be described as powerful tools that can improve various 
aspects of financial analysis (Krause, 2023). Therefore, by synthesising 
data, generative artificial intelligence models help analysts, managers, 
and investors achieve high performance in creating financial reports, 
detecting risks, predicting market trends, and optimising portfolios 
(Forbes, 2023). The study aims to discover the financial capabilities of 
artificial intelligence in the field of finance and evaluate its 
performance through an investment analysis case study. In this regard, 
Microsoft leveraged Bing AI, an AI-powered search engine that uses 
advanced techniques to provide answers to questions, powered by 
OpenAI's Prometheus Model 1. Bing AI was asked to analyse the 
financial statements of the companies in the BIST100 index for the 
years 2019–2022 and create two portfolios according to traditional and 
modern portfolio theories. On the other hand, Bing AI has proposed a 
single portfolio consisting of AKBNK, GARAN, ASELS, THYAO, 
TTKOM, and KCHOL stocks, taking into account both modern and 
traditional portfolio approaches. When Bing AI was asked about the

weight of stocks in the portfolio, it stated that they were of equal 
weight. 
As a case study, the risks and returns of the portfolio proposed 
by Bing AI in the period January 2023–November 2023 were examined 
in order to measure the degree of its capabilities in the financial field. 
Accordingly, the risks and returns of the stocks included in the 
portfolio were examined, and when the average returns were 
examined, it was seen that the stock with the lowest return and highest 
risk was ASELS, and the average returns of the other stocks had very 
similar risk returns. When the risk and return of the portfolio 
recommended by Bing AI were calculated, it was found that the 
portfolio had a return of 3.8% against a risk of 14.8%. It is clear from 
the Sample-2 portfolio that if the stocks suggested by Bing AI are 
weighted into different alternatives, there are higher possibilities of 
achieving them at lower risk. 
Although the risk of the portfolio created by Bing AI is 
relatively high, at least the positive return gives hope for the success of 
Bing AI's investment consultancy. However, the fact that he only gives 
literary answers when asked to use both modern portfolio and 
traditional portfolio methods, and his inability to apply this 
information when creating a portfolio, casts a shadow on the reliability 
of the suggestion he offers. In addition, although the portfolio 
suggested by Bing AI provides positive returns, it is possible to say 
that there is a need to improve the financial capabilities of Bing AI, as 
there are more effective portfolios such as Sample 1–3 created with 
different weighting combinations of the same stocks. In general, when 
the financial capabilities of Bing AI are evaluated, it is impossible not

to say that it provides support to people who have basic knowledge in 
the field of finance. In future studies, the financial analysis, evaluation, 
and interpretation abilities of artificial intelligence models can be 
examined, the expectations of artificial intelligence in the field of 
finance can be revealed, and suggestions can be made to artificial 
intelligence developers.
