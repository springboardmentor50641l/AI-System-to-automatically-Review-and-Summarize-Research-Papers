  "abstract": "This study evaluated the performance of a vertebral fracture detection algorithm (HealthVCF) in a real-life setting and \nassessed the impact on treatment and diagnostic workflow. HealthVCF was used to identify moderate and severe vertebral \ncompression fractures (VCF) at a Danish hospital. Around 10,000 CT scans were processed by the HealthVCF and CT scans \npositive for VCF formed both the baseline and 6-months follow-up cohort. To determine performance of the algorithm 1000 \nCT scans were evaluated by specialized radiographers to determine performance of the algorithm. Sensitivity was 0.68 (CI \n0.581–0.776) and specificity 0.91 (CI 0.89–0.928). At 6-months follow-up, 18% of the 538 patients in the retrospective \ncohort were dead, 78 patients had been referred for a DXA scan, while 25 patients had been diagnosed with osteoporosis. A \nhigher mortality rate was seen in patients not known with osteoporosis at baseline compared to patients known with osteo-\nporosis at baseline, 12.8% versus 22.6% (p = 0.003). Patients receiving bisphosphonates had a lower mortality rate (9.6%) \ncompared to the rest of the population (20.9%) (p = 0.003). HealthVCF demonstrated a poorer performance than expected, \nand the tested version is not generalizable to the Danish population. Based on its specificity, the HealthVCF can be used as \na tool to prioritize resources in opportunistic identification of VCF’s. Implementing such a tool on its own only resulted in a \nsmall number of new diagnoses of osteoporosis and referrals to DXA scans during a 6-month follow-up period. To increase \nefficiency, the HealthVCF should be integrated with Fracture Liaison Services (FLS).\nKeywords  Osteoporosis · Vertebral fracture · Fracture prevention · Health services research · Osteoporosis · Radiology · \nScreening",
  "introduction": "Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease characterized by \nreduced bone mass and micro architectural deterioration of \nbone tissue, increasing the risk of fractures [1]. Fragility \nfractures, especially vertebral compression fractures (VCF), \nare a significant health concern associated with higher mor-\nbidity [2–5] and mortality [6, 7]. The importance of preva-\nlent vertebral deformities has also been investigated, indi-\ncating that vertebral deformity is correlated with risk of all \nfractures. This underscores the significance of early VCF \ndetection to initiate osteoporosis treatment for fracture pre-\nvention [8–10]\nUnlike other osteoporotic fractures, VCFs often go unno-\nticed due to various factors, including the absence of symp-\ntoms, non-specific symptoms, and limited clinical attention \n[11–13]. VCFs not only increase the imminent fracture risk \nbut also the lifetime risk of fractures [14–16].\nIn the clinical context, the definition of a VCF remains \nuncertain. Various methods, including semi-quantitative, \nquantitative or a combination of both, are used to evaluate \nvertebral body height and shape, although a gold standard \ndoes not exist [17]. The semi-quantitative method described \nby Genant is easier to implement with a fair degree of repro-\nducibility and accuracy. Studies have shown moderate to \ngood correlation between Genant’s semiquantitative and \nquantitative methods, especially for moderate to severe \nfractures [17].\n * Magnus Grønlund Bendtsen \n \nmag.bendtsen@gmail.com\n1 \nResearch Unit, Medical Department, Zealand University \nHospital, Koege, Denmark\n2 \nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, \nKoege, Denmark\n\n469\nOpportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…\nVCFs can be diagnosed incidentally during computed \ntomography scans (CT scans) ordered for reasons unre-\nlated to osteoporosis. However, these fractures are often \nnot reported in radiology reports because their clinical \nimportance is not adequately emphasized. Identifying \nVCFs opportunistically during CT scans for any indica-\ntion could improve patient identification without signifi-\ncantly burdening hospitals in terms of time and resources \n[18–20]. Thus, it provides the clinician with the oppor-\ntunity to treat the patient and reduce future fracture risk. \nTo address this issue, Nano-X Ai Ltd has developed the \nHealthVCF algorithm, aimed at assisting radiologists in \ndetecting frequently overlooked lesions. The HealthVCF \nis a passive notification for prioritization-only, parallel-\nworkflow software tool used by clinicians to prioritize spe-\ncific patients within the standard-of-care bone health set-\nting for suspected vertebral compression fractures. It uses \nan artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze chest and \nabdominal CT scans and flags those that are suggestive of \nthe presence of at least one vertebral compression at the \nexam level. The operational performance of the Health-\nVCF has been examined previously. In a study conducted \nat an Israeli hospital, both training and validation were \nperformed within the same study. Validation was con-\nducted on 15% of 1673 CT scans of the chest or abdomen \nfrom 3701 adults aged 50 or older, comprising approxi-\nmately 250 CT studies. The algorithm demonstrated a \nsensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 94% [21]. In a US \nhospital, the algorithm showed sensitivity and specific-\nity in diagnosing any VCF of 0.66 and 0.90, respectively. \nFor diagnosing moderate/severe VCF the sensitivity and \nspecificity were 0.78 and 0.87 [22], respectively. A study \nconducted in Australia investigated the HealthVCF in a \nreal-life clinical setting at a single imaging center, inde-\npendent of the software’s development/training site. Here, \nthe detection of Genant 2 or Genant 3 fractures showed \nsensitivity of 65%, specificity of 92%, and accuracy of \n88% in 1288 scans [23]. The poorer performance in the \nAustralian study is an example of limited generalizability, \nwhere AI algorithms show great performance in develop-\nment environments, but poorer performance when used on \nreal-world data [24]. To assess the real-world performance \nof an AI algorithm such as the HealthVCF, a paired design \ncan be used to do a comparative evaluation of the perfor-\nmance between the AI algorithm and the conventional way \nof diagnosing vertebral fractures [24].\nThe aim of our study was to assess the performance of \nan updated version of the algorithm in identifying prev-\nalent moderate/severe VCFs on CT scans of thorax and \nabdomen (CTAB) in a real-life setting and to evaluate the \nimpact of implementation on registration of diagnoses, \nreferral to DXA and medical treatment.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe HealthVCF, version 5.1.1, was installed and con-\nfigured for the highest specificity on a server in January \n2021 at the Department of Radiology, Zealand University \nHospital (ZUH). It was set to identify Genant 2–3 (mod-\nerate/severe) VFCs on CTAB of patients referred to the \nRadiology Department during the study period, provided \npatients met the inclusion criteria. No human interaction \nwas involved in handling of the input data.\nIf a moderate/severe VCF was identified by the Health-\nVCF, an additional scan image was added by the software \nto the CT scan series, before the examination was returned \nto the imaging system (Radiology Information system), \nRIS (Picture Archiving and Communication System, \nPACS). The HealthVCF used the Genant semi-quantita-\ntive method for diagnosing VCFs. The evaluation by the \nHealthVCF was done in real-time and did not delay the \nconduct of the CTAB. Scans identified with one or more \nmoderate/severe compression fractures, were denoted pos-\nitive scans. All scans evaluated by the HealthVCF were \nidentified by accession number, registered on a weekly \nworklist with indications of the presence of moderate/\nsevere VCF, and sent to the study team.\nFollowing standard procedures all scans were evaluated \nin real-time by the department’s radiologists and special-\nized radiographers according to clinical question. A report \nof evaluation was sent to the referring physician according \nto standard procedures.\nA group of five specialized radiographers, with an aver-\nage of 21 years (10–28 years) of radiographic experience \nincluding evaluation of CT scans of the spine, constituted \nthe study team. Their instruction was to evaluate whether \none or more moderate/severe VFCs were present. The \nstudy team was trained in the workflow prior to the start \nof study, and in inconclusive cases a senior radiologist was \nconsulted. The evaluation by the specialized radiographers \nand/or radiologists constituted the gold standard.\nValidation Study\nTo evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a Danish \npopulation, a total of 1000 CTAB were randomly selected \nand evaluated by both specialized radiographers and the \nHealthVCF. The radiographers were blinded to both the \nstudy report and the outcome from the HealthVCF, when \nevaluating the scans. The 1000 CTAB were selected by \nusing Microsoft Excel to randomly assign each scan from \nthe study period with a number and then present scan 1 to \n\n470\n \nM. G. Bendtsen, M. F. Hitz \n1000 on a worklist for evaluation by the study team. No \nreporting of findings was done in this part of the study.\nFollow‑Up Cohort at 6 Months\nAfter a 6-month follow-up period, a retrospective cohort was \nformed. The cohort was formed by having the study team \nanalyze all scans flagged positive for a VCF by the Health-\nVCF. Only patients with CTAB determined true positive \nfor a VCF were included in the cohort. CTABs not flagged \nby the HealthVCF were not analyzed by the study-team but \nwere analyzed by the radiologist at the time of CTAB, fol-\nlowing standard procedure. For CTAB determined true posi-\ntive for a VCF by the study team, the radiographer looked up \nthe initial report. If no VCF had been reported, a standard-\nized sentence was added to report alerting the referring phy-\nsician to the VCF and noting that osteoporosis assessment \nwas advised. If the VCF was already described in the initial \nreport, no action was taken. After 6 months from CTAB all \ndata were entered into a Redcap database.\nStudy Population\nThe study population includes both inpatients and outpa-\ntients at Zealand University Hospital in Koege referred \nfor CTAB for all indications except fractures. The study \nincluded both women and men, aged 50 years and older. \nIndividuals without a social security number (tourist) and \nindividuals from other geographical regions were excluded. \nThe aim was to evaluate 10,000 CTABs, and the study \nperiod ended when this number was reached. The cohort \nidentification period was from 01.23.2022 to 10.25.2022.\nExclusion criteria encompassed cases involving CTAB \nconducted as part of PET scans and instances where assess-\nment of the vertebral column was not possible as judged by \nthe radiographer/radiologist. CTAB for fracture identifica-\ntion were excluded, as well as cases of incomplete exams \nand wrong region of interest. No performance error analysis \nwas conducted as it was outside the study’s scope.\nThe study was approved as a quality assurance/develop-\nment study by the local data committee (REG-145-2021) \nand the hospital’s board of directors, at the guidance of the \nDanish Health Authorities. Approval by the ethical commit-\ntee was not required for this type of study, as no intervention \nwas done, and all patient-related data was collected retro-\nspectively. Adherence to CONSORT-AI 2020 guidelines is \ndetailed in the supplementary material.\nVariables: Follow‑Up Cohort\nAt the time of the CTAB (baseline), the following data were \nregistered for each patient: age, sex, indication for CTAB, \nspecialty of referring physician, known with osteoporosis \n(yes/no), current treatment for osteoporosis (yes/no), medi-\ncation, and for description of work-flow, whether the fracture \nwas described in the primary radiology report or added by \nstudy team.\nAt 6 months follow-up the following data were registered \nfor each patient: vital status, referral for DXA scan, specialty \nof referring physician, initiation or adjustment of osteopo-\nrosis treatment, choice of treatment, and registration of the \nosteoporosis diagnosis.\nPatients were classified as having known osteoporosis \nif any of the following criteria were met: a diagnosis code \nfor osteoporosis in the electronic patient journal (EPJ), a \nDXA scan result with a T-score below or equal to − 2.5 in \nlumbar spine or hip region, or if the patient was receiving \nanti-osteoporosis medication.\nDetails on indication for CTAB, specialties of referring \nphysicians and data sources are found in supplementary \nmaterial.\nStatistics\nTo assess the test’s diagnostic accuracy, the number of true \npositives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives \nwas calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative \nlikelihood ratios, Youden Index, as well as positive and neg-\native predictive values were calculated by means of standard \nformulae. A joint 95% confidence interval was calculated \nusing Clopper-Pearson formula.\nDescriptive data were presented as number of patients in \neach category; groups were compared using either independ-\nent sample t-test for continuous data or Pearsons Chi-square \ntest for categorical data. If necessary, p-values were Bonfer-\nroni corrected by multiplying p value with n = test for n ≤ 6.\nStatistical significance of 5% was used. All data were ana-\nlyzed with SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois), version 21.",
  "results": "Validation Study and Identification of Retrospective \nCohort\nOne thousand scans were evaluated in the validation study, \nwith sensitivity being 0.68 (CI 0.58–0.78) and specificity \n0.91 (CI 0.89–0.93) (Table 1). Accuracy was 88.9% and \nYouden Index was 0.59. The prevalence of one or more \nmoderate or severe VCFs for the population in the valida-\ntion study was 9.5%.\nDuring the cohort identification period, a total of \n10,012 CTABs were included. Among these, 1543 CTABs \nwere categorized as HealthVCF positive for moderate/\nsevere compression fractures. Evaluation of the Health-\nVCF-positive scans resulted in exclusion of 177 scans. Of \n\n471\nOpportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…\nthe remaining 1366 HealthVCF-positive scans, 630 were \nfound to be true positive for moderate to severe VCFs. Of \nthe 630 CT scans, 538 were included in the database as the \nretrospective cohort (Fig. 1). Eighty-two of the excluded \nscans were excluded due to absence of documentation on \nfractures in the radiology reports. The lack of documenta-\ntion resulted from the evaluator’s judgment that the sub-\njects had a limited life expectancy, constituting a breach \nof the protocol. The final retrospective cohort consisted of \n318 women and 220 men.\nMean age of participants was 76 ± 8 years, and women \nwere significantly older than men, 77 ± 8 years versus 75 ± 8 \nyears (p = 0.013). At the time of the CTAB (baseline), a total \nof 250 patients (46.4%) were diagnosed with osteoporosis. \nAmong them, a significantly higher percentage were women \n(74.4%) (p < 0.0001) (Table 2).\nOf the patients classified as having known osteoporosis at \nbaseline, 68.4% were receiving anti-osteoporosis treatment, \n44.4% had a DXA scan with T-score < − 2.5 in either the hip \nregion or lumbar spine and 52.0% had a registered diagnose \nof osteoporosis (see supplemental material). The distribution \nof anti-osteoporosis treatment in the 171 patients (68.4%) \nreceiving anti-osteoporosis treatment at baseline is shown \nin Table 3.\nIndication for CT scan is seen in Table 2, and the spe-\ncialty of referring physician is shown in the supplementary \nmaterial.\nFor work-flow analysis, the findings of a VCF were \ndescribed in the primary radiology report in 91% of cases \nand added secondarily in 9% of the cases. More VCFs were \ndescribed in the primary report towards the end of the \nstudy period, indicating a time factor. In the first half of \nthe study, 12.9–26.5% of the findings were added after the \nprimary report, while in the second half, this occurred in \nonly 0.0–4.2% of the cases (p < 0.001).\n6‑Months Follow Up\nAt 6-months follow up, 441 of the patients in the retrospec-\ntive cohort were alive, 97 had died, and none were lost to \nfollow-up (Table 3). Significantly more patients not known \nwith osteoporosis at baseline were dead at 6 months com-\npared to patients known with osteoporosis at baseline; 12.8% \nversus 22.6% (p = 0.003). There was no difference in mortal-\nity between men (20.9%) and women (16.0%) (p = 0.148), \nand no difference in mortality between the retrospective \ncohort (18.0%) and the 82 patients excluded from the cohort \nby radiographers’ choice not to evaluate the CTAB (22.8%) \n(p = 0.276). Patients receiving bisphosphonates had a lower \nmortality of 9.6% compared to the rest of the population \n20.9% (p = 0.003).\nThe mortality in the retrospective cohort, stratified by the \nindication for the CTAB, was as follows: 62/200 (31.0%) for \nacute exams, 12/117 (10.3%) for diagnostic exams, 20/127 \n(15.7%) for oncological control exams and 3/94 (3.2%) for \nother control exams. The mortality was significantly higher \nfor patients referred for an acute exam compared to diag-\nnostic exam (p = 0.006) and other control scans (p = 0.006) \nbut not significantly higher compared to patients referred \nfor an oncological exam (p = 0.12) after Bonferroni correc-\ntion. Furthermore, mortality of patients referred for other \ncontrol exams was lower compared to patients referred for \noncological exam (p = 0.018) but not when comparing to \npatients referred for a diagnostic CT scan (p = 0.282) after \nBonferroni correction.

  "discussion": "Performance of the Algorithm and Fracture \nPrevalence\nOur objective was to validate the HealthVCF algorithm \nwithin a Danish hospital environment and to explore the \nimpact of its implementation on osteoporosis diagnosis and \nmanagement over a 6-month follow-up period. The sen-\nsitivity for finding moderate/severe VCFs were 68%, and \nthe specificity 91%. This is, especially for the sensitivity, \nbelow what is shown in the FDA approval of the Health-\nVCF, where sensitivity and specificity were 90.20% (95% CI \n[86.35%;93.05%]) and 86.89% (95% CI [82.63%;90.22%]), \nrespectively.\nA recent meta-analysis comparing the performance \nof similar algorithms showed better average performance \nacross 14 algorithms, with sensitivity 85.7% (95% CI \n78.6–90.7) and specificity 93.5% (95% CI 89.5–96.1) [25]. \nComparing our results to the results of the meta-analysis \nsuggests that the tested HealthVCF has poorer performance \nthan what could be expected.\nComparing our results with results of Kolanu et al. [23], \nwho tested the same algorithm, we found an almost identi-\ncal performance. Together with results from Australia, our \nresults point to a poorer performance of the HealthVCF than \nwhat is shown in the regulatory data. The subpar perfor-\nmance is a testament to the lack of generalizability to the \nDanish population.\nThe accuracy of the HealthVCF was 88.9%, and it dem-\nonstrated a Youden Index of 0.59.\nA Youden Index of 0 is equivalent to a coin toss, and \na Youden Index of 1.0 represents the perfect test. With a \nYouden Index of 0.59, the HealthVCF has a fairly good \nperformance. To determine its usefulness, sensitivity and \nspecificity must be considered. With a sensitivity of 0.68, \napproximately 32% out of all scans flagged positive for ver-\ntebral fracture will be false positive. With such a low sensi-\ntivity, the HealthVCF cannot be used to diagnose vertebral \nTable 2   Characteristics of patients and baseline data for baseline \ncohort, n = 538\nThe proportion of women compared to men was significantly higher \nfor the oncological exam compared to acute exam (p < 0.03)*, diag-\nnostic exam (p < 0.003)** and control scan (p < 0.006)***.

This over-calling of frac-\ntures means that all positive scans must be analyzed by a \nspecialist, leading to increased expenditure. In our study \nradiographers spent 5–10 min on average analyzing each \nimage generated by the HealthVCF, including lookup, analy-\nsis, and potential reporting. In 1000 scans, this translates to \nsomewhere between 12 and 24 h of work by radiographers to \ncorrectly diagnose fractures in 65 patients out of 146 flagged \nscans.\nFocusing on the specificity of 0.91, things are looking \nbetter. About 9 out of 10 scans not flagged by the HealthVCF \nwill be true negative. This means that the radiographic spe-\ncialist can be fairly sure that no vertebral fracture is present \nwhen a scan is not flagged by HealthVCF. Though this is not \nperfect, the HealthVCF might be used by a Department of \nRadiology to increase their reporting of vertebral fractures \nwithout the need to analyze the spine of every CTAB. This \nminimizes the resources spent on opportunistic identification \nof vertebral fractures.\nThe variability in performance compared to previous \nstudies may be explained by differences in population \nfracture risk and the variability in evaluation based on the \nmethod of evaluation [17, 21]. Morphometric evaluation \nmethods, whether quantitative or semi-quantitative have \nbeen thoroughly documented [17, 26] and diagnosing Grade \n1 (mild) VCFs presents a diagnostic challenge due to notable \ndiscrepancies in interpretation among radiologists, leading \nto an elevated risk of false positive results.\nBoth clinical and non-clinical VCFs are associated with \nfuture fractures risk with lower association for grade 1 com-\npared to grade 2 and 3. This might be explained by the lower \nTable 3   Osteoporosis \ndiagnoses, deaths and \nmedication in baseline cohort, \nn = 538 and 6 months follow-up \ncohort, n = 441\nOP osteoporosis\n*Under medical treatment revision—new treatment to be decided\nPatients\nKnown with OP at \nbaseline\nNot known with OP \nat baseline\nTotal\nBaseline cohort, n\n250\n288\n538\n Anti-osteoporosis treatment at baseline, n\n171\n0\n171\n Oral bisphosphonates\n90\n  I.V bisphosphonates\n45\n  Denosumab\n35\n  Teriparatide\n1\n  Romosozumab\n0\n  Unknown\n0\n Deaths during follow-up, n\n32\n65\n97\n6 months follow-up cohort, n\n218\n223\n441\n Anti-osteoporosis treatment at baseline, n\n154\n0\n154\n  Oral bisphosphonates\n83\n83\n  I.V bisphosphonates\n39\n39\n  Denosumab\n31\n31\n  Teriparatide\n1\n1\n  Romosozumab\n0\n0\n  Unknown\n0\n0\n No anti-osteoporosis treatment at baseline, n\n64\n223\n287\n Anti-osteoporosis treatment at 6 months follow-\nup, n (changes from baseline)\n154\n23\n177 (+ 23)\n  Oral bisphosphonates\n68\n14\n82 (− 1)\n  I.V bisphosphonates\n40\n5\n45 (+ 6)\n  Denosumab\n37\n0\n37 (+ 6)\n  Teriparatide\n3\n2\n5 (+ 4)\n  Romosozumab\n0\n2\n2 (+ 2)\n  Unknown\n6*\n0\n6 (+ 6)\n No anti-osteoporosis treatment at 6 months \nfollow-up, n (changes from baseline)\n53\n200\n253 (− 34)\n Referred for DXA at 6 months follow-up, n\n41\n37\n78\n\n475\nOpportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…\nspecificity of the methods in diagnosing mild fractures [8, \n10, 27–29].

The prevalence of VCFs var-\nies in different studies and populations, which may in part be \nexplained by difference in population-risk, method used for \nevaluation, but also the grades of fractures included in the \nstudies. One study reported the prevalence of morphometric \nVCFs in Scandinavia to be 26% and 18% in Eastern Europe \n[30]. Another study found a prevalence of 12% [31] and a \nthird a prevalence of 9.5% [20]. Though age ranged from \n20 to 88 years in the third study, no VCFs were identified in \nthe younger patients (< 44 years). A different study found \nan overall prevalence of 35%; 73% of these were grade 1 \nfractures, 19% grade 2 and 9% grade 3 [18]. The prevalence \nfor moderate/severe VCFs in the study was 9.5%, equiva-\nlent to our report, indication that that part of the variability \nin prevalence between studies is related to the diagnosis of \nmild fractures.\nIn our study, 48% of patients in the retrospective cohort \nhad known osteoporosis at baseline; of these 74.4% were \nwomen. This is anticipated due to the higher incidence of \nosteoporosis in women and the tendency for osteoporosis in \nmen to go unnoticed [32, 33]. Many studies have evaluated \nincident findings of VCF on chest radiographs or CTAB, but \nfew studies report on patients’ osteoporosis- and treatment \nstatus at the time of identification. Barton et al. evaluated the \nclinical outcome of VCF identification and reported that at \ntime of VCF diagnosis, 21% were receiving anti-osteoporo-\nsis treatment [34]. In comparison, we found that 31% of the \nFig. 2   Diagnostic workflow upon CT verified vertebral fracture in population not known with osteoporosis at baseline, n = 223. N number of \npatients, DXA dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, EPJ electronic patient journal\n\n476\n \nM. G. Bendtsen, M. F. Hitz \nretrospective cohort were receiving treatment at baseline. \nPatients in this study were labeled known with osteoporosis \nbased on either an osteoporosis diagnose code in the EPJ, \nDXA results with a diagnostic T-score in the EPJ or current \ntreatment with anti-osteoporosis drug. This method may lack \nprecision due the existence of different EPJ systems in Den-\nmark. If patients have previously resided in other geographi-\ncal regions, their DXA results may go unnoticed. Adding to \nthis, patients diagnosed at their GP may not have a diagnosis \nin the EPJ, resulting in an underestimation of patients with \nan osteoporosis diagnosis. Conversely, information about \ncurrent treatment and diagnosis is nationally centralized. \nOur analysis revealed that 48% of patients with known osteo-\nporosis did not possess an official diagnosis but were either \nundergoing treatment or had a diagnostic T-score. To be able \nto provide an accurate representation of disease prevalence, \nproper diagnosis registration is essential.\nEffect of Intervention\nAt the 6-months follow-up, 97 of the patients in the retro-\nspective cohort had died, resulting in a mortality rate of 18%. \nThe mortality was higher in the group of patients not known \nwith osteoporosis (68%) compared to the group known with \nosteoporosis (32%). This was not explained by differences \nin reason for referral (indication for CT scan). Comorbidity, \nlike cancer, and previous osteoporotic fractures, especially \nhip fractures, may be confounding factors explaining the \ndifference in mortality between the two groups, but we have \nno data on these variables. Bisphosphonates were used for \ntreatment in 79% of the patients under current osteoporosis \ntreatment in the cohort. The mortality in patients treated \nwith bisphosphonates was significantly lower compared to \nthe rest of the cohort, i.e. patient on other treatments or not \nin current treatment. Bisphosphonates were only registered \nif the indication was osteoporosis. Other studies have shown \nthat treatment with bisphosphonates reduces overall mortal-\nity, but there is not sufficient data to support this hypothesis \n[35–38]. Another explanation for a higher mortality in the \ngroup not known with osteoporosis, may be lack of attention \ntoward osteoporosis in presence of other chronic- or severe \ndisease. It is known that a large treatment gap is present in \nosteoporosis, and it is assumed that the gap is linked to both \na gap in diagnosis and lack of awareness. It is not known if \nthe presence of other chronic or severe diseases is the cause \nof the gap in osteoporosis diagnosis [39].\nThe aim of opportunistic identification of VCFs is to \nensure appropriate assessment and treatment of the patients \nto reduce risk of future fractures and mortality. At 6 months, \n18% of the retrospective cohort were referred for a DXA \nscan and 11% were either started on anti-osteoporosis \ntreatment or changed to a more potent anti-osteoporosis \ntreatment. As noted earlier, few studies report on clinical \noutcomes of fracture identification, but Barton et al. reported \nthat within 2 years after a clinical VCF, 2% of patients had a \nDXA scan and 7% initiated anti-osteoporosis treatment [34]. \nThus, our results show a higher DXA referral rate compared \nto the study by Barton et al.\nWorkflow of Action\nAnalysis of the workflow data showed that GPs and medical \nspecialists had the highest rate of acting on the reporting of \na VCF. This can be due to both GPs and medical specialists \nbeing specialties with knowledge on diagnosis and treatment \nof osteoporosis.\nThe analysis also showed that 91% VFC’s detected were \ndescribed in the primary radiology report, and that the \nhighest rate was seen at the end of the study. This indicates \nincreased awareness among radiologists during the study, \nbut it also demonstrates that a high rate of VCF detection is \nonly part of the solution to closing the treatment gap, given \nthat only 25 of the 233 patients not known with osteoporosis \nreceived an osteoporosis diagnosis within 6 months. Higher \nefficiency could be accomplished by integrating HealthVCF \nwith a fracture prevention program like Fracture Liaison \nService (FLS), an internationally validated method of sys-\ntematically identifying, evaluating and initiating anti-osteo-\nporosis treatment for patients with recent fractures [40]. The \nprograms are shown to increase likelihood for subsequent \nBMD testing [41, 42].\nThe rate of VCF reporting in this study is higher than \nin the literature, where the reporting of incident VCFs on \nCT scans was found to be 9% [18], 13% [19], 14.6% [20], \n32.56% [43] and 24.7% [13]. The high report rate in our \nstudy is likely due to the radiologists’ knowledge of the \nongoing study, whereas the underreporting noted in other \nstudies might be due to radiologists’ lack of focus on bone-\nstatus, as opportunistic screening for VCFs is a non-acute \nfinding during exams often performed in an acute setting \n[44]. The problem of underreporting might be solved by \nusing a dedicated team to evaluate the HealthVCF findings \noutside the clinical context, as done in this study. With such \na workflow, the radiologists sparse time and resources are \npreserved for more acute findings.\nIn this study, 46.7% of the deaths that occurred during the \n6-month follow-up period had an acute exam or an oncologi-\ncal follow-up as indication for the CTAB. This shows that \nopportunistic screening might be inefficient in this subset \nof the population. Additionally, we observed that the radi-\nographers opted to exclude certain patients from the cohort \ndue to their assessment of a short life expectancy. However, \nthe mortality in this group was no different from that of the \nrest of the cohort, thus demonstrating that it is difficult to \npredict mortality. The high mortality rate of 18% in the stud-\nied population underscores the need to incorporate a way to \n\n477\nOpportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…\nspare the system of ineffective use of resources and to spare \nvery ill patients the time and energy of attending consulta-\ntions, going to scans and initiating unnecessary treatment. \nThis could be done by developing a clinical decision tool \nto help the FLS team to identify which patients to refer for \nfurther assessment and treatment based on their risk of dying \nand the predicted benefit of attending an FLS. Such a tool \nhas previously been developed by Ong et al. [45].\nStrengths and Limitations\nOne limitation of this study is the choice to use only one \nradiographer instead of two to determine the presence of \nfractures in each of the 1000 scans used for evaluation of \nperformance. Ideally two radiographers would conduct a \nseparate analysis of each scan to ensure validity, though the \nuse of only one radiographer does not seem to have affected \nthe result, as our sensitivity and specificity are similar to that \nfound in a recent study of the same algorithm [23]. Another \nlimitation is the short follow-up period, as it might be too \nlimited a time frame for every physician to act on the radi-\nologist’s report, especially in the presence of other severe \ndiseases. Finally, the number of patients diagnosed with \nosteoporosis during the follow-up period might be underes-\ntimated due to osteoporosis diagnoses not being registered \nin the EPJ when given by a GP.\nA strength of this study is the use of a retrospective \ncohort, giving data on indication for scan, diagnosis, medi-\ncations and referral to DXA. This data is what makes it pos-\nsible to determine the real-life impact of an algorithm such \nas the HealthVCF, as the end goal is not only to detect but \nto prevent fractures.",
  "conclusion": "In conclusion we confirm previous findings of the Health-\nVCFs poor performance in a real-world setting. It is not \ngeneralizable to the Danish population as it is over-calling \npatients and missing 1 in 10 VCFs. Even though the tested \nversion of the HealthVCF needs improvement in accuracy \nbefore it can be used for opportunistic identification of \nVCF independently of human oversight, the current version \ncan be used to increase reporting of vertebral fractures by \nprioritizing which CT scans to analyze for potential VCF. \nImplementing the HealthVCF with human oversight without \nties to FLS, only resulted in a low number of new diagno-\nses of osteoporosis and referrals to DXA among patients \nnot known with osteoporosis at time of the CT scan. This \nfinding, together with the high mortality rate in the studied \npopulation and lack of action among specialties other than \nGP’s and medical specialists, highlights a need for FLS-\nteams to ensure the efficiency of the HealthVCF.\nSupplementary Information  The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https://​doi.​org/​10.​1007/​s00223-​024-​01196-2.\nAcknowledgements  We express gratitude to Mettemarie Tange and \nKirsten Susse Licht from the Zealand Regional Data Team for their \nvital contributions.
