Abstract
This study evaluated the performance of a vertebral fracture detection algorithm (HealthVCF) in a real-life setting and 
assessed the impact on treatment and diagnostic workflow. HealthVCF was used to identify moderate and severe vertebral 
compression fractures (VCF) at a Danish hospital. Around 10,000 CT scans were processed by the HealthVCF and CT scans 
positive for VCF formed both the baseline and 6-months follow-up cohort. To determine performance of the algorithm 1000 
CT scans were evaluated by specialized radiographers to determine performance of the algorithm. Sensitivity was 0.68 (CI 
0.581–0.776) and specificity 0.91 (CI 0.89–0.928). At 6-months follow-up, 18% of the 538 patients in the retrospective 
cohort were dead, 78 patients had been referred for a DXA scan, while 25 patients had been diagnosed with osteoporosis. A 
higher mortality rate was seen in patients not known with osteoporosis at baseline compared to patients known with osteo-
porosis at baseline, 12.8% versus 22.6% (p = 0.003). Patients receiving bisphosphonates had a lower mortality rate (9.6%) 
compared to the rest of the population (20.9%) (p = 0.003). HealthVCF demonstrated a poorer performance than expected, 
and the tested version is not generalizable to the Danish population. Based on its specificity, the HealthVCF can be used as 
a tool to prioritize resources in opportunistic identification of VCF’s. Implementing such a tool on its own only resulted in a 
small number of new diagnoses of osteoporosis and referrals to DXA scans during a 6-month follow-up period. To increase 
efficiency, the HealthVCF should be integrated with Fracture Liaison Services (FLS).

Introduction
Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease characterized by 
reduced bone mass and micro architectural deterioration of 
bone tissue, increasing the risk of fractures [1]. Fragility 
fractures, especially vertebral compression fractures (VCF), 
are a significant health concern associated with higher mor-
bidity [2–5] and mortality [6, 7]. The importance of preva-
lent vertebral deformities has also been investigated, indi-
cating that vertebral deformity is correlated with risk of all 
fractures. This underscores the significance of early VCF 
detection to initiate osteoporosis treatment for fracture pre-
vention [8–10]
Unlike other osteoporotic fractures, VCFs often go unno-
ticed due to various factors, including the absence of symp-
toms, non-specific symptoms, and limited clinical attention 
[11–13]. VCFs not only increase the imminent fracture risk 
but also the lifetime risk of fractures [14–16].
In the clinical context, the definition of a VCF remains 
uncertain. Various methods, including semi-quantitative, 
quantitative or a combination of both, are used to evaluate 
vertebral body height and shape, although a gold standard 
does not exist [17]. The semi-quantitative method described 
by Genant is easier to implement with a fair degree of repro-
ducibility and accuracy. Studies have shown moderate to 
good correlation between Genant’s semiquantitative and 
quantitative methods, especially for moderate to severe 
fractures [17].

Opportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…
VCFs can be diagnosed incidentally during computed 
tomography scans (CT scans) ordered for reasons unre-
lated to osteoporosis. However, these fractures are often 
not reported in radiology reports because their clinical 
importance is not adequately emphasized. Identifying 
VCFs opportunistically during CT scans for any indica-
tion could improve patient identification without signifi-
cantly burdening hospitals in terms of time and resources 
[18–20]. Thus, it provides the clinician with the oppor-
tunity to treat the patient and reduce future fracture risk. 
To address this issue, Nano-X Ai Ltd has developed the 
HealthVCF algorithm, aimed at assisting radiologists in 
detecting frequently overlooked lesions. The HealthVCF 
is a passive notification for prioritization-only, parallel-
workflow software tool used by clinicians to prioritize spe-
cific patients within the standard-of-care bone health set-
ting for suspected vertebral compression fractures. It uses 
an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze chest and 
abdominal CT scans and flags those that are suggestive of 
the presence of at least one vertebral compression at the 
exam level. The operational performance of the Health-
VCF has been examined previously. In a study conducted 
at an Israeli hospital, both training and validation were 
performed within the same study. Validation was con-
ducted on 15% of 1673 CT scans of the chest or abdomen 
from 3701 adults aged 50 or older, comprising approxi-
mately 250 CT studies. The algorithm demonstrated a 
sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 94% [21]. In a US 
hospital, the algorithm showed sensitivity and specific-
ity in diagnosing any VCF of 0.66 and 0.90, respectively. 
For diagnosing moderate/severe VCF the sensitivity and 
specificity were 0.78 and 0.87 [22], respectively. A study 
conducted in Australia investigated the HealthVCF in a 
real-life clinical setting at a single imaging center, inde-
pendent of the software’s development/training site. Here, 
the detection of Genant 2 or Genant 3 fractures showed 
sensitivity of 65%, specificity of 92%, and accuracy of 
88% in 1288 scans [23]. The poorer performance in the 
Australian study is an example of limited generalizability, 
where AI algorithms show great performance in develop-
ment environments, but poorer performance when used on 
real-world data [24]. To assess the real-world performance 
of an AI algorithm such as the HealthVCF, a paired design 
can be used to do a comparative evaluation of the perfor-
mance between the AI algorithm and the conventional way 
of diagnosing vertebral fractures [24].
The aim of our study was to assess the performance of 
an updated version of the algorithm in identifying prev-
alent moderate/severe VCFs on CT scans of thorax and 
abdomen (CTAB) in a real-life setting and to evaluate the 
impact of implementation on registration of diagnoses, 
referral to DXA and medical treatment.
Methods
Study Design
The HealthVCF, version 5.1.1, was installed and con-
figured for the highest specificity on a server in January 
2021 at the Department of Radiology, Zealand University 
Hospital (ZUH). It was set to identify Genant 2–3 (mod-
erate/severe) VFCs on CTAB of patients referred to the 
Radiology Department during the study period, provided 
patients met the inclusion criteria. No human interaction 
was involved in handling of the input data.
If a moderate/severe VCF was identified by the Health-
VCF, an additional scan image was added by the software 
to the CT scan series, before the examination was returned 
to the imaging system (Radiology Information system), 
RIS (Picture Archiving and Communication System, 
PACS). The HealthVCF used the Genant semi-quantita-
tive method for diagnosing VCFs. The evaluation by the 
HealthVCF was done in real-time and did not delay the 
conduct of the CTAB. Scans identified with one or more 
moderate/severe compression fractures, were denoted pos-
itive scans. All scans evaluated by the HealthVCF were 
identified by accession number, registered on a weekly 
worklist with indications of the presence of moderate/
severe VCF, and sent to the study team.
Following standard procedures all scans were evaluated 
in real-time by the department’s radiologists and special-
ized radiographers according to clinical question. A report 
of evaluation was sent to the referring physician according 
to standard procedures.
A group of five specialized radiographers, with an aver-
age of 21 years (10–28 years) of radiographic experience 
including evaluation of CT scans of the spine, constituted 
the study team. Their instruction was to evaluate whether 
one or more moderate/severe VFCs were present. The 
study team was trained in the workflow prior to the start 
of study, and in inconclusive cases a senior radiologist was 
consulted. The evaluation by the specialized radiographers 
and/or radiologists constituted the gold standard.
Validation Study
To evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a Danish 
population, a total of 1000 CTAB were randomly selected 
and evaluated by both specialized radiographers and the 
HealthVCF. The radiographers were blinded to both the 
study report and the outcome from the HealthVCF, when 
evaluating the scans. The 1000 CTAB were selected by 
using Microsoft Excel to randomly assign each scan from 
the study period with a number and then present scan 1 to

1000 on a worklist for evaluation by the study team. No 
reporting of findings was done in this part of the study.
Follow‑Up Cohort at 6 Months
After a 6-month follow-up period, a retrospective cohort was 
formed. The cohort was formed by having the study team 
analyze all scans flagged positive for a VCF by the Health-
VCF. Only patients with CTAB determined true positive 
for a VCF were included in the cohort. CTABs not flagged 
by the HealthVCF were not analyzed by the study-team but 
were analyzed by the radiologist at the time of CTAB, fol-
lowing standard procedure. For CTAB determined true posi-
tive for a VCF by the study team, the radiographer looked up 
the initial report. If no VCF had been reported, a standard-
ized sentence was added to report alerting the referring phy-
sician to the VCF and noting that osteoporosis assessment 
was advised. If the VCF was already described in the initial 
report, no action was taken. After 6 months from CTAB all 
data were entered into a Redcap database.
Study Population
The study population includes both inpatients and outpa-
tients at Zealand University Hospital in Koege referred 
for CTAB for all indications except fractures. The study 
included both women and men, aged 50 years and older. 
Individuals without a social security number (tourist) and 
individuals from other geographical regions were excluded. 
The aim was to evaluate 10,000 CTABs, and the study 
period ended when this number was reached. The cohort 
identification period was from 01.23.2022 to 10.25.2022.
Exclusion criteria encompassed cases involving CTAB 
conducted as part of PET scans and instances where assess-
ment of the vertebral column was not possible as judged by 
the radiographer/radiologist. CTAB for fracture identifica-
tion were excluded, as well as cases of incomplete exams 
and wrong region of interest. No performance error analysis 
was conducted as it was outside the study’s scope.
The study was approved as a quality assurance/develop-
ment study by the local data committee (REG-145-2021) 
and the hospital’s board of directors, at the guidance of the 
Danish Health Authorities. Approval by the ethical commit-
tee was not required for this type of study, as no intervention 
was done, and all patient-related data was collected retro-
spectively. Adherence to CONSORT-AI 2020 guidelines is 
detailed in the supplementary material.
Variables: Follow‑Up Cohort
At the time of the CTAB (baseline), the following data were 
registered for each patient: age, sex, indication for CTAB, 
specialty of referring physician, known with osteoporosis 
(yes/no), current treatment for osteoporosis (yes/no), medi-
cation, and for description of work-flow, whether the fracture 
was described in the primary radiology report or added by 
study team.
At 6 months follow-up the following data were registered 
for each patient: vital status, referral for DXA scan, specialty 
of referring physician, initiation or adjustment of osteopo-
rosis treatment, choice of treatment, and registration of the 
osteoporosis diagnosis.
Patients were classified as having known osteoporosis 
if any of the following criteria were met: a diagnosis code 
for osteoporosis in the electronic patient journal (EPJ), a 
DXA scan result with a T-score below or equal to − 2.5 in 
lumbar spine or hip region, or if the patient was receiving 
anti-osteoporosis medication.
Details on indication for CTAB, specialties of referring 
physicians and data sources are found in supplementary 
material.
Statistics
To assess the test’s diagnostic accuracy, the number of true 
positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives 
was calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
likelihood ratios, Youden Index, as well as positive and neg-
ative predictive values were calculated by means of standard 
formulae. A joint 95% confidence interval was calculated 
using Clopper-Pearson formula.
Descriptive data were presented as number of patients in 
each category; groups were compared using either independ-
ent sample t-test for continuous data or Pearsons Chi-square 
test for categorical data. If necessary, p-values were Bonfer-
roni corrected by multiplying p value with n = test for n ≤ 6.
Statistical significance of 5% was used. All data were ana-
lyzed with SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois), version 21.
Results
Validation Study and Identification of Retrospective 
Cohort
One thousand scans were evaluated in the validation study, 
with sensitivity being 0.68 (CI 0.58–0.78) and specificity 
0.91 (CI 0.89–0.93) (Table 1). Accuracy was 88.9% and 
Youden Index was 0.59. The prevalence of one or more 
moderate or severe VCFs for the population in the valida-
tion study was 9.5%.
During the cohort identification period, a total of 
10,012 CTABs were included. Among these, 1543 CTABs 
were categorized as HealthVCF positive for moderate/
severe compression fractures. Evaluation of the Health-
VCF-positive scans resulted in exclusion of 177 scans. Of 

471
Opportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…
the remaining 1366 HealthVCF-positive scans, 630 were 
found to be true positive for moderate to severe VCFs. Of 
the 630 CT scans, 538 were included in the database as the 
retrospective cohort (Fig. 1). Eighty-two of the excluded 
scans were excluded due to absence of documentation on 
fractures in the radiology reports. The lack of documenta-
tion resulted from the evaluator’s judgment that the sub-
jects had a limited life expectancy, constituting a breach 
of the protocol. The final retrospective cohort consisted of 
318 women and 220 men.
Mean age of participants was 76 ± 8 years, and women 
were significantly older than men, 77 ± 8 years versus 75 ± 8 
years (p = 0.013). At the time of the CTAB (baseline), a total 
of 250 patients (46.4%) were diagnosed with osteoporosis. 
Among them, a significantly higher percentage were women 
(74.4%) (p < 0.0001) (Table 2).
Of the patients classified as having known osteoporosis at 
baseline, 68.4% were receiving anti-osteoporosis treatment, 
44.4% had a DXA scan with T-score < − 2.5 in either the hip 
region or lumbar spine and 52.0% had a registered diagnose 
of osteoporosis (see supplemental material). The distribution 
of anti-osteoporosis treatment in the 171 patients (68.4%) 
receiving anti-osteoporosis treatment at baseline is shown 
in Table 3.
Indication for CT scan is seen in Table 2, and the spe-
cialty of referring physician is shown in the supplementary 
material.
For work-flow analysis, the findings of a VCF were 
described in the primary radiology report in 91% of cases 
and added secondarily in 9% of the cases. More VCFs were 
described in the primary report towards the end of the 
study period, indicating a time factor. In the first half of 
the study, 12.9–26.5% of the findings were added after the 
primary report, while in the second half, this occurred in 
only 0.0–4.2% of the cases (p < 0.001).
6‑Months Follow Up
At 6-months follow up, 441 of the patients in the retrospec-
tive cohort were alive, 97 had died, and none were lost to 
follow-up (Table 3). Significantly more patients not known 
with osteoporosis at baseline were dead at 6 months com-
pared to patients known with osteoporosis at baseline; 12.8% 
versus 22.6% (p = 0.003). There was no difference in mortal-
ity between men (20.9%) and women (16.0%) (p = 0.148), 
and no difference in mortality between the retrospective 
cohort (18.0%) and the 82 patients excluded from the cohort 
by radiographers’ choice not to evaluate the CTAB (22.8%) 
(p = 0.276). Patients receiving bisphosphonates had a lower 
mortality of 9.6% compared to the rest of the population 
20.9% (p = 0.003).
The mortality in the retrospective cohort, stratified by the 
indication for the CTAB, was as follows: 62/200 (31.0%) for 
acute exams, 12/117 (10.3%) for diagnostic exams, 20/127 
(15.7%) for oncological control exams and 3/94 (3.2%) for 
other control exams. The mortality was significantly higher 
for patients referred for an acute exam compared to diag-
nostic exam (p = 0.006) and other control scans (p = 0.006) 
but not significantly higher compared to patients referred 
for an oncological exam (p = 0.12) after Bonferroni correc-
tion. Furthermore, mortality of patients referred for other 
control exams was lower compared to patients referred for 
oncological exam (p = 0.018) but not when comparing to 
patients referred for a diagnostic CT scan (p = 0.282) after 
Bonferroni correction. Among the 441 patients in the follow-
up cohort, 218 were known with osteoporosis at baseline. At

6 months follow up, 37 of the 223 patients not known with 
osteoporosis at baseline were referred for DXA scan, 25 had 
a new diagnosis of osteoporosis in EPJ, and 23 were started 
on anti-osteoporosis treatment (Fig. 2).
Of the 218 known with osteoporosis at baseline, 154 
were on medical treatment at baseline (Table 3). Out of the 
64 patients not on medical treatment, 41 were referred for 
DXA, and 11 were started on anti-osteoporosis treatment 
at the time of the 6-months follow-up. None were regis-
tered with a new diagnosis in EPJ based on the result. Of 
the 154 patients on anti-osteoporosis treatment at baseline 
16 were changed in medication based on the results (see 
supplemental material).

DXA Referral and Workflow
In the follow-up cohort a total of 78 were referred for DXA 
scan. There was no difference in age 74.9 years (8.9) and 
76.4 (7.7) [mean (SD)] (p = 0.140) or female/male ratio 
(48/30) and (219/144) (p = 0.843), for those referred for 
DXA versus those who were not, respectively.
Out of the 78 patients referred for a DXA scan, 32.1% 
(n = 25) were referred by the same physician who did the 
initial referral to the CT scan. Among these, 40.0% (n = 10) 
came from the medical department, 36% (n = 9) from general 
practitioners (GP), and 8.0% (n = 2) from the surgical depart-
ment and private surgical clinics respectively. Additionally, 
4.0% (n = 1) were referred by the intensive care unit and the 
oncological department, respectively.
Fifty-three (67.9%) patients were referred for a DXA scan 
by other physicians, with 43.4% (n = 23) coming from the 
medical department, 35.8% (n = 19) from general practition-
ers, 13.2% (n = 7) from specialist clinics, and 1.9% (n = 1) 
from the intensive care unit and the emergency department, 
respectively.
Discussion
Performance of the Algorithm and Fracture 
Prevalence
Our objective was to validate the HealthVCF algorithm 
within a Danish hospital environment and to explore the 
impact of its implementation on osteoporosis diagnosis and 
management over a 6-month follow-up period. The sen-
sitivity for finding moderate/severe VCFs were 68%, and 
the specificity 91%. This is, especially for the sensitivity, 
below what is shown in the FDA approval of the Health-
VCF, where sensitivity and specificity were 90.20% (95% CI 
[86.35%;93.05%]) and 86.89% (95% CI [82.63%;90.22%]), 
respectively.
A recent meta-analysis comparing the performance 
of similar algorithms showed better average performance 
across 14 algorithms, with sensitivity 85.7% (95% CI 
78.6–90.7) and specificity 93.5% (95% CI 89.5–96.1) [25]. 
Comparing our results to the results of the meta-analysis 
suggests that the tested HealthVCF has poorer performance 
than what could be expected.
Comparing our results with results of Kolanu et al. [23], 
who tested the same algorithm, we found an almost identi-
cal performance. Together with results from Australia, our 
results point to a poorer performance of the HealthVCF than 
what is shown in the regulatory data. The subpar perfor-
mance is a testament to the lack of generalizability to the 
Danish population.
The accuracy of the HealthVCF was 88.9%, and it dem-
onstrated a Youden Index of 0.59.
A Youden Index of 0 is equivalent to a coin toss, and 
a Youden Index of 1.0 represents the perfect test. With a 
Youden Index of 0.59, the HealthVCF has a fairly good 
performance. To determine its usefulness, sensitivity and 
specificity must be considered. With a sensitivity of 0.68, 
approximately 32% out of all scans flagged positive for ver-
tebral fracture will be false positive. With such a low sensi-
tivity, the HealthVCF cannot be used to diagnose vertebral

fractures without human oversight, as stated by the manu-
facturer in their FDA application. This over-calling of frac-
tures means that all positive scans must be analyzed by a 
specialist, leading to increased expenditure. In our study 
radiographers spent 5–10 min on average analyzing each 
image generated by the HealthVCF, including lookup, analy-
sis, and potential reporting. In 1000 scans, this translates to 
somewhere between 12 and 24 h of work by radiographers to 
correctly diagnose fractures in 65 patients out of 146 flagged 
scans.
Focusing on the specificity of 0.91, things are looking 
better. About 9 out of 10 scans not flagged by the HealthVCF 
will be true negative. This means that the radiographic spe-
cialist can be fairly sure that no vertebral fracture is present 
when a scan is not flagged by HealthVCF. Though this is not 
perfect, the HealthVCF might be used by a Department of 
Radiology to increase their reporting of vertebral fractures 
without the need to analyze the spine of every CTAB. This 
minimizes the resources spent on opportunistic identification 
of vertebral fractures.
The variability in performance compared to previous 
studies may be explained by differences in population 
fracture risk and the variability in evaluation based on the 
method of evaluation [17, 21]. Morphometric evaluation 
methods, whether quantitative or semi-quantitative have 
been thoroughly documented [17, 26] and diagnosing Grade 
1 (mild) VCFs presents a diagnostic challenge due to notable 
discrepancies in interpretation among radiologists, leading 
to an elevated risk of false positive results.
Both clinical and non-clinical VCFs are associated with 
future fractures risk with lower association for grade 1 com-
pared to grade 2 and 3. This might be explained by the lower

Opportunistic Identification of Vertebral Compression Fractures on CT Scans of the Chest and…
specificity of the methods in diagnosing mild fractures [8, 
10, 27–29]. Based on this knowledge, we focused on identi-
fying only moderate/severe VCFs in this study.
The prevalence of patients with moderate/severe VCFs 
in the validation study was 9.5%. This is a low prevalence 
compared to previous studies. The prevalence of VCFs var-
ies in different studies and populations, which may in part be 
explained by difference in population-risk, method used for 
evaluation, but also the grades of fractures included in the 
studies. One study reported the prevalence of morphometric 
VCFs in Scandinavia to be 26% and 18% in Eastern Europe 
[30]. Another study found a prevalence of 12% [31] and a 
third a prevalence of 9.5% [20]. Though age ranged from 
20 to 88 years in the third study, no VCFs were identified in 
the younger patients (< 44 years). A different study found 
an overall prevalence of 35%; 73% of these were grade 1 
fractures, 19% grade 2 and 9% grade 3 [18]. The prevalence 
for moderate/severe VCFs in the study was 9.5%, equiva-
lent to our report, indication that that part of the variability 
in prevalence between studies is related to the diagnosis of 
mild fractures.
In our study, 48% of patients in the retrospective cohort 
had known osteoporosis at baseline; of these 74.4% were 
women. This is anticipated due to the higher incidence of 
osteoporosis in women and the tendency for osteoporosis in 
men to go unnoticed [32, 33]. Many studies have evaluated 
incident findings of VCF on chest radiographs or CTAB, but 
few studies report on patients’ osteoporosis- and treatment 
status at the time of identification. Barton et al. evaluated the 
clinical outcome of VCF identification and reported that at 
time of VCF diagnosis, 21% were receiving anti-osteoporo-
sis treatment [34]. In comparison, we found that 31% of the

retrospective cohort were receiving treatment at baseline. 
Patients in this study were labeled known with osteoporosis 
based on either an osteoporosis diagnose code in the EPJ, 
DXA results with a diagnostic T-score in the EPJ or current 
treatment with anti-osteoporosis drug. This method may lack 
precision due the existence of different EPJ systems in Den-
mark. If patients have previously resided in other geographi-
cal regions, their DXA results may go unnoticed. Adding to 
this, patients diagnosed at their GP may not have a diagnosis 
in the EPJ, resulting in an underestimation of patients with 
an osteoporosis diagnosis. Conversely, information about 
current treatment and diagnosis is nationally centralized. 
Our analysis revealed that 48% of patients with known osteo-
porosis did not possess an official diagnosis but were either 
undergoing treatment or had a diagnostic T-score. To be able 
to provide an accurate representation of disease prevalence, 
proper diagnosis registration is essential.
Effect of Intervention
At the 6-months follow-up, 97 of the patients in the retro-
spective cohort had died, resulting in a mortality rate of 18%. 
The mortality was higher in the group of patients not known 
with osteoporosis (68%) compared to the group known with 
osteoporosis (32%). This was not explained by differences 
in reason for referral (indication for CT scan). Comorbidity, 
like cancer, and previous osteoporotic fractures, especially 
hip fractures, may be confounding factors explaining the 
difference in mortality between the two groups, but we have 
no data on these variables. Bisphosphonates were used for 
treatment in 79% of the patients under current osteoporosis 
treatment in the cohort. The mortality in patients treated 
with bisphosphonates was significantly lower compared to 
the rest of the cohort, i.e. patient on other treatments or not 
in current treatment. Bisphosphonates were only registered 
if the indication was osteoporosis. Other studies have shown 
that treatment with bisphosphonates reduces overall mortal-
ity, but there is not sufficient data to support this hypothesis 
[35–38]. Another explanation for a higher mortality in the 
group not known with osteoporosis, may be lack of attention 
toward osteoporosis in presence of other chronic- or severe 
disease. It is known that a large treatment gap is present in 
osteoporosis, and it is assumed that the gap is linked to both 
a gap in diagnosis and lack of awareness. It is not known if 
the presence of other chronic or severe diseases is the cause 
of the gap in osteoporosis diagnosis [39].
The aim of opportunistic identification of VCFs is to 
ensure appropriate assessment and treatment of the patients 
to reduce risk of future fractures and mortality. At 6 months, 
18% of the retrospective cohort were referred for a DXA 
scan and 11% were either started on anti-osteoporosis 
treatment or changed to a more potent anti-osteoporosis 
treatment. As noted earlier, few studies report on clinical 
outcomes of fracture identification, but Barton et al. reported 
that within 2 years after a clinical VCF, 2% of patients had a 
DXA scan and 7% initiated anti-osteoporosis treatment [34]. 
Thus, our results show a higher DXA referral rate compared 
to the study by Barton et al.
Workflow of Action
Analysis of the workflow data showed that GPs and medical 
specialists had the highest rate of acting on the reporting of 
a VCF. This can be due to both GPs and medical specialists 
being specialties with knowledge on diagnosis and treatment 
of osteoporosis.
The analysis also showed that 91% VFC’s detected were 
described in the primary radiology report, and that the 
highest rate was seen at the end of the study. This indicates 
increased awareness among radiologists during the study, 
but it also demonstrates that a high rate of VCF detection is 
only part of the solution to closing the treatment gap, given 
that only 25 of the 233 patients not known with osteoporosis 
received an osteoporosis diagnosis within 6 months. Higher 
efficiency could be accomplished by integrating HealthVCF 
with a fracture prevention program like Fracture Liaison 
Service (FLS), an internationally validated method of sys-
tematically identifying, evaluating and initiating anti-osteo-
porosis treatment for patients with recent fractures [40]. The 
programs are shown to increase likelihood for subsequent 
BMD testing [41, 42].
The rate of VCF reporting in this study is higher than 
in the literature, where the reporting of incident VCFs on 
CT scans was found to be 9% [18], 13% [19], 14.6% [20], 
32.56% [43] and 24.7% [13]. The high report rate in our 
study is likely due to the radiologists’ knowledge of the 
ongoing study, whereas the underreporting noted in other 
studies might be due to radiologists’ lack of focus on bone-
status, as opportunistic screening for VCFs is a non-acute 
finding during exams often performed in an acute setting 
[44]. The problem of underreporting might be solved by 
using a dedicated team to evaluate the HealthVCF findings 
outside the clinical context, as done in this study. With such 
a workflow, the radiologists sparse time and resources are 
preserved for more acute findings.
In this study, 46.7% of the deaths that occurred during the 
6-month follow-up period had an acute exam or an oncologi-
cal follow-up as indication for the CTAB. This shows that 
opportunistic screening might be inefficient in this subset 
of the population. Additionally, we observed that the radi-
ographers opted to exclude certain patients from the cohort 
due to their assessment of a short life expectancy. However, 
the mortality in this group was no different from that of the 
rest of the cohort, thus demonstrating that it is difficult to 
predict mortality. The high mortality rate of 18% in the stud-
ied population underscores the need to incorporate a way to

spare the system of ineffective use of resources and to spare 
very ill patients the time and energy of attending consulta-
tions, going to scans and initiating unnecessary treatment. 
This could be done by developing a clinical decision tool 
to help the FLS team to identify which patients to refer for 
further assessment and treatment based on their risk of dying 
and the predicted benefit of attending an FLS. Such a tool 
has previously been developed by Ong et al. [45].
Strengths and Limitations
One limitation of this study is the choice to use only one 
radiographer instead of two to determine the presence of 
fractures in each of the 1000 scans used for evaluation of 
performance. Ideally two radiographers would conduct a 
separate analysis of each scan to ensure validity, though the 
use of only one radiographer does not seem to have affected 
the result, as our sensitivity and specificity are similar to that 
found in a recent study of the same algorithm [23]. Another 
limitation is the short follow-up period, as it might be too 
limited a time frame for every physician to act on the radi-
ologist’s report, especially in the presence of other severe 
diseases. Finally, the number of patients diagnosed with 
osteoporosis during the follow-up period might be underes-
timated due to osteoporosis diagnoses not being registered 
in the EPJ when given by a GP.
A strength of this study is the use of a retrospective 
cohort, giving data on indication for scan, diagnosis, medi-
cations and referral to DXA. This data is what makes it pos-
sible to determine the real-life impact of an algorithm such 
as the HealthVCF, as the end goal is not only to detect but 
to prevent fractures.
Conclusion
In conclusion we confirm previous findings of the Health-
VCFs poor performance in a real-world setting. It is not 
generalizable to the Danish population as it is over-calling 
patients and missing 1 in 10 VCFs. Even though the tested 
version of the HealthVCF needs improvement in accuracy 
before it can be used for opportunistic identification of 
VCF independently of human oversight, the current version 
can be used to increase reporting of vertebral fractures by 
prioritizing which CT scans to analyze for potential VCF. 
Implementing the HealthVCF with human oversight without 
ties to FLS, only resulted in a low number of new diagno-
ses of osteoporosis and referrals to DXA among patients 
not known with osteoporosis at time of the CT scan. This 
finding, together with the high mortality rate in the studied 
population and lack of action among specialties other than 
GP’s and medical specialists, highlights a need for FLS-
teams to ensure the efficiency of the HealthVCF.
